You would be working ~37.5 hours a week at 1 of or both of the health centers located in Albuquerque, with travel to Santa Fe a posibility. You may need to travel to Denver for 2-4 weeks during the first 1-2 months for training. To train in CO you will need to apply for a CO APN License as soon as you are moved through to credentialing. We will reimburse you for the license application fee upon starting and you will be reimbursed for all travel expenses for training.
