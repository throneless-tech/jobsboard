Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH) is a collaborative research group at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)'s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. We seek an experienced facilitator to assist our planning group in designing and leading an engaging, productive, and fun two-day, off-site retreat for our 50 staff and faculty members. The retreat will take place in the SF Bay Area. The primary goals of the ANSIRH retreat are to build trust, community, energy, and commitment among all ANSIRH colleagues by creating more connections and forging new connections between individuals, cultivating and strengthening cross-team relationships, and having fun together! Work will start in early 2022 and continue through one-month post-retreat (mid-June 2022). The retreat will take place near the San Francisco Bay Area over one full-day and one half-day. The possible dates for the retreat are May 4-5, 2022 and May 18-19, 2022. Please see the attached RFP for more information
