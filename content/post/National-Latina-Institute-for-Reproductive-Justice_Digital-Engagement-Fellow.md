Latina Institute seeks bilingual (Spanish-English) digital engagement fellows who are passionate about reproductive justice to help engage, activate, mobilize, and organize supporters, activists, and allies of Latina Institute digitally. The fellows will help build independent, progressive political power through developing, leading, and executing digital content via our digital channels (social media, email, text, EveryAction) to help organize state-based campaigns that build our base of supporters, activists, and leaders for reproductive justice.
