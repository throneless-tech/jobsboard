The State Communications Strategist will forward PRH’s mission by supporting the state-based media advocacy of our network of almost 500 physician advocates across the country. They will respond to the real time needs of our provider network while serving as one of PRH’s representatives at state-based communications coalition tables. They will work on messaging, written media opportunities, and collaborate with the Assistant Director of State Policy and the Digital Strategist to align the needs of our provider community with PRH’s state policy strategy. They will manage reporter relationships for state and local media outlets, handle the logistics of interview prep and organization with our Board Members and Leadership Training Academy Fellows, and pitch relevant and timely story ideas to members of the media.
