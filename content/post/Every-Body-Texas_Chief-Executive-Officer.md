Mission – To ensure that every person in Texas can access safe, unbiased, and high-quality sexual and reproductive health.

To achieve our mission, Every Body Texas funds providers of sexual and reproductive healthcare in Texas by administering federal Title X funding and supports this network of providers by delivering innovative training and technical assistance.  Every Body Texas has an annual budget of approximately $17 million, most of which is distributed to our provider network of 36 agencies operating 175 clinic sites across the state. In 2019, this network provided comprehensive, high quality family planning services to more than 142,000 individuals, many of whom were low income. Located in Austin, Every Body Texas has a strong, trusted relationship with our provider network, funding partners, and other key stakeholders. Last year in response to the COVID pandemic, we identified innovative ways to carry out our work and we provide the highest levels of support to our provider network in a continuously challenging environment.

We are currently engaged in a multi-year Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) initiative that is intended to positively impact service delivery at the local level as well as our internal operations. Equally important is our expanding presence as a state and national advocate for funding and program policies that promote and ensure access to services. Our current work is focused on these overarching goals:

    Expand services and funding to best serve the sexual and reproductive healthcare needs of the people of Texas.
    Establish Every Body Texas as a leader on the issues concerning sexual and reproductive healthcare to engage the public and policymakers.
    Build an organizational structure and culture that reflects our values of access, equity, dignity, and innovation.

We are led by a diverse, visionary, and committed Board of Directors. We are financially strong and supported by a well-trained professional staff. We are optimistic about the future and ready to make the most of any opportunities that support access to sexual and reproductive healthcare for all Texans.
