Mostly clinic-based outpatient reproductive health clinic, providing family planning, STI, and breast/cervical cancer screening services. Our team is also engaged in COVID vaccination activities for the foreseeable future, about one day per week. Some flexibility with telework about one day per week, otherwise work is in-person in our Columbia Health Center. Spanish fluency preferred.
