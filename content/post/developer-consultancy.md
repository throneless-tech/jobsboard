SAAF is looking for an individual or team to redesign our existing website based on needs we have already identified from our grantee partners, donors and other users. We currently use Squarespace and wish to continue using this platform â€“ we are not looking for an entirely new stand-alone
website but rather a refresh which can be completed by the end of this year. We welcome applicants with experience of working globally, and in SRHR.
