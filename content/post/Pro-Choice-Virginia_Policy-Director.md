Pro-Choice Virginia (PCV) is at a point of exciting transformation and faces a critical need to re-envision strategies to ensure reproductive freedom and access. The new Policy Director will be the strategic brain of our policy and legislative programming to lead that charge, working closely with our executive director, staff, and state and national partners to advance Pro-Choice Virginiaâ€™s policy and legislative priorities. Our ideal candidate will have a breadth of experience and success in legislative advocacy and/or issue-based campaigns; experience centering the needs and voices of those most affected by reproductive or other systemic injustice; exceptional written and verbal communication skills; an aptitude for strategic thinking; and the organizational skills to manage themselves and others to implement various policy and communication strategies to achieve our goals and fulfill our mission every day.
