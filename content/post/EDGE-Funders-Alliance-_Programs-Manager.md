EDGE Funders Alliance is seeking a full-time Programs Manager to lead the design and implementation of all programmatic initiatives (in-person and online), support learning and collaboration among network members and social movement allies through our intersectional justice initiatives, contribute to approaches that increase the visibility of the organization to key audiences, and advance strategic goals.

This is an ideal role for someone who is interested in being a part of a small, decentralized, global team that works closely to build collective power for change through funder and social movement organizing. The Programs Manager will ensure that EDGE’s programs are aligned with our values and meaningfully contribute to our goals, and supervise the Programs and Communications Coordinator’s work to implement a communications approach that is integrated into and adds value to the programmatic and organizational strategies.
