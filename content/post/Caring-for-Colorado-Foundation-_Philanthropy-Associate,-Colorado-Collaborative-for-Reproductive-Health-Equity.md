We are currently seeking a Philanthropy Associate to work with a small team to advance the work of the Collaborative. The Philanthropy Associate will be responsible for managing current operations of the Collaborative and working with
the Director to develop future strategies. The Philanthropy Associate reports to the Director of the Colorado Collaborative for Reproductive Health Equity. The Colorado Collaborative for Reproductive Health Equity (the Collaborative) is an initiative jointly funded by the Caring for Colorado Foundation and The Colorado Health Foundation. The focus of our work is to ensure a robust reproductive health care system in Colorado that is grounded in and upholds reproductive health equity, and authentically engages with Colorado communities in planning and implementing its work, so that that all people have access to the information and services they need to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and
fertility.
