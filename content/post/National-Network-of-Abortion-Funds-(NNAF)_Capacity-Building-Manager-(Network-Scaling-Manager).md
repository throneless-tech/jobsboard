The Capacity Building Manager (Network Scaling Manager) is responsible for building network capacity and strategy for organizational development of member funds, with specific emphasis on communities of practice (learning cohorts) to leverage the unique strengths and relationships of our network. The Manager is part of the newly formed Technical Assistance Team, which will eventually be six people. The Capacity Building Manager (Network Scaling Manager) works primarily with leaders in member abortion funds, and technical assistance providers for our scaling pilot program. They have an overall interest in infrastructure development and processes that strengthen fund sustainability, and support abortion fund change management as they grow into having staff, robust organizational budgets, and developing thriving organizational cultures. They supervise assigned staff, support collaboration across departments, and work in close partnership with the Technical Assistance Manager and the Technical Assistance Director in supporting the design, development, and implementation of organizational plans to scale the network. The Capacity Building Manager is committed to bringing a racial, economic, and reproductive justice lens to traditional organizational development competencies.
