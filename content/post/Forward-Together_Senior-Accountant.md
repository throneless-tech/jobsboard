Forward Together and Forward Together Action is in search of a Senior Accountant. This is an amazing opportunity for a highly skilled leader to help shape the financial infrastructure of a dynamic 501(c) 3 organization, whose budget and staff have grown three-fold in recent years, and whose programs continue to grow in complexity, scale, and reach and will also help develop the financial infrastructure of an affiliate 501(c)(4) partner organization. This position is responsible for all ongoing accounting tasks, working under the supervision of the Director of Finance (DF) and within the policies and protocols set by the DF, the Executive Team, and the Board of Directors of Forward Together and Forward Together Action, an affiliate 501(c)(4) partner organization. The Senior Accountant must run bookkeeping on time and with precision yet keep an eye to the entirety of the accounting system, maintaining proper documentation for all financial activity and ensuring consistency and clarity of systems for both organizations. The Senior Accountant coordinates finance filings from staff, assists the DF, and communicates with outside entities regarding accounting matters as needed. This position requires close collaboration with multiple stakeholders and works in partnership with the DF to manage the finances of the two entities.
