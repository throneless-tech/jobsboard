The Bernard and Audre Rapoport Center for Human Rights and Justice, an interdisciplinary center housed at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, is seeking a postgraduate fellow, preferably with criminal defense experience, to work at the intersection of criminal law and reproductive rights. The fellow will work alongside staff and faculty connected with the new Sissy Farenthold Reproductive Justice Legal Defense Resource Project, which aims to ensure quality legal resources for people criminally charged or investigated in Texas based on pregnancy outcomes.
