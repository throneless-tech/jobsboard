CFC seeks a passionate and driven advocate for reproductive freedom to serve as the Florida Organizing and Movement Building Associate. Responsible for executing the organization’s engagement plan to successfully pass the “Amendment to Limit Government Interference with Abortion” ballot initiative, the ideal candidate will possess knowledge of community organizing efforts on the ground in the state of Florida as well as a desire to encounter pro-choice Catholics and develop their leadership while working closely with faith-based and secular coalition partners. The Florida Organizing & Movement Building Associate must feel comfortable working in a fast-paced, ever-changing environment, centering faith, Catholic social teaching, and most impacted by abortion restrictions in all that they do.
