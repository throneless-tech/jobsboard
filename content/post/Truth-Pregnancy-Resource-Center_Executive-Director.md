We are seeking an Executive Director to lead our start-up, non-profit organization that arises out of the First Unitarian Church of Dallas's decades-long commitment to people's reproductive rights and freedoms. We are seeking someone passionate about providing people with honest, accurate, comprehensive information and counseling about their pregnancy and all potential options. You will play a pivotal role in the establishment and growth of our center, shaping our mission and achieving our objectives while creating an environment with access to resources in ways that are equitable and identity-affirming. The ideal candidate will have a strong background in non-profit management, fundraising, strategic planning, and team leadership.
