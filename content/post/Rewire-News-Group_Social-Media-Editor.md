Rewire News Group is hiring a social media editor to help us expand our inspired and interactive online community, and increase awareness, readership, and sharing of our work at this critical time for reproductive rights, health, and justice. Our ideal candidate is a voracious news consumer and expert in social media best practices who is tuned into conversations happening on all social platforms, is able to spot content trends as they are happening, can capitalize on breaking news moments, and works well under pressure and collaboratively as part of a team. As part of our editorial team, the social media editor will create, edit, produce, and promote digital content, including Twitter threads, Instagram posts, and related work. The ideal candidate will have previous experience in journalism or a similar space; a strong working knowledge of reproductive rights, health, and justice issues; thrive in a fast-paced news-centric environment; and is a self-starter who can function both independently and as part of the broader team.
