The Communications Director is responsible for IfNotNow’s public voice and strategy. This role drives the big picture thinking and the rapid-fire decision making needed to drive our movement’s narrative strategy across traditional media and digital platforms. This role leads on developing a coherent story to tell about IfNotNow’s ongoing organizing, as well as inserting IfNotNow’s analysis into the public discourse as news breaks. The role is highly collaborative: the Communications Director participates in conversations with IfNotNow’s broader staff team to craft strategy, and in turn involves staff, volunteers, and partners in creating messaging that can balance the many considerations involved in speaking to the Jewish community about Israel/Palestine.

The ideal candidate will have communications experience, collaboration skills, familiarity with the Jewish community's relationship to Israel/Palestine, and a commitment to speaking to people who don’t already agree with us.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sr3DmIOald8ylK2laY_Z7GYgGGQgvt4hqNfyWItdfiY/edit?usp=sharing
