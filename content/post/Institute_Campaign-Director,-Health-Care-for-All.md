The primary function of the Campaign Director, Health Care for All is to lead our Health Care team to win corporate campaigns, federal legislative campaigns, and our recently launched Care Over Cost campaign pointing out the challenges of the for-profit healthcare industry and their insurance companies. 

Our organization has a track record of leadership in coordinating field mobilization and advocacy in advancing health care for all and opposing attempts to cut the Affordable Care Act and other health care programs. Our member organizations across the country run state-level campaigns and often lead statewide coordinating advocacy tables, and have been at the forefront of educating and mobilizing people around critical health care issues.
