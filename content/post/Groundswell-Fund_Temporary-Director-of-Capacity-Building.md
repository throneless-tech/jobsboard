The Director of Capacity Building is responsible for leading Groundswell’s capacity-building department, which supports grassroots organizations to build grassroots power and improve conditions for their communities. The department resources two cohorts of grantees focused on deepening their voter engagement capacity (the Integrated Voter Engagement program) and sharpening their grassroots organizing skills (the Grassroots Organizing Institute). It also offers a newer and expanding body of work providing political education around theories of social change and intersectional organizing and as well as resources for healing justice to sustain leaders and organizations. The Director of Capacity Building will develop and manage the annual departmental work plan and budget and supervise Program Managers and others to ensure high quality program delivery and effective relationships with grantees. They will work closely with Program Managers to co-manage a team of more than 20 coaches and consultants. They will work to ensure that Groundswell’s capacity building programs are meeting our Blueprint plan targets, are responsive to the needs of our grantees and the field, and that our grantees are supported holistically by all field-facing staff at Groundswell. They will serve as a public representative of Groundswell and the department with funders and other audiences.
