We are currently seeking Field Directors to join us on an important and exciting campaign to help Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic rally the vote for candidates who will protect our right to make our own decisions and keep the government out of our health care. We are hiring for multiple Lead Director and Deputy Director positions in Charlotte, Raleigh, and Wilmington. North Carolina’s sweeping abortion ban and restrictions on reproductive health care are harming real people. Bans on any health care put politics above people and put our futures on the line. We’re working to ensure that everyone can live, thrive, and raise families in healthy communities. When people can make decisions about their own reproductive health care, they have more control over their economic security, their health and well-being, and can build the future they see for themselves. 
Politicians have no business interfering with private health care decisions. We’re fighting to stop this government intrusion and put the power back in the hands of the people.
