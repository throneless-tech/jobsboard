We are seeking an intern to support the Reproductive Rights teamâ€™s Research Program from January to June 2023. The ideal candidate will be committed to racial equity and progressive values while being passionate about reproductive health, rights, and justice. This person should have a knowledge base of the public health/social science/clinical research related to reproductive health (including abortion care, contraception, and maternal health care) and be comfortable condensing and translating research for a policymaker audience.
