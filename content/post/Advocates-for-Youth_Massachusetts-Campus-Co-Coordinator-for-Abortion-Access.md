Advocates for Youth will engage two consultants as Campus Coordinators who will manage efforts to organize Massachusetts students, support storytellers, and work with state-based partners to expand access to on-campus medication abortion in Massachusetts. 

The Campus Coordinators will work to identify key student leaders on each Massachusetts public university campus, working closely with established campus groups and organizational chapters. Once identified, the Campus Coordinators will co-create and co-lead statewide trainings for the student leaders, educating them on policy advocacy, campus organizing, and reproductive rights and justice.
