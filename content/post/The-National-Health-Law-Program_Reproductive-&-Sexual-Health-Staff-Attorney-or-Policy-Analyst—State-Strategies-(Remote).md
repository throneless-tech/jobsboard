THE POSITION

We are seeking a full time, junior Staff Attorney or Policy Analyst to help to develop and implement NHeLP's legal, policy, and advocacy strategies for advancing access to quality reproductive and sexual health, with a focus on state work. In particular, they will assist our RSH team with our policy advocacy capacity-building efforts at the interface of RSH and Medicaid in the U.S. South, as well as our work to improve state contraceptive access policies nationwide. 
The ideal candidate will have prior experience in reproductive and sexual health, rights, or justice, as well as working knowledge of the Medicaid program and Affordable Care Act. This candidate will think strategically and respond quickly to changing circumstances; have an interest in and willingness to listen and learn in partnership with state advocates; demonstrate strong leadership, communication, research, and writing skills; and be able to work individually and in teams. They will have experience working within communities of color and will demonstrate an understanding of the issues of contraceptive equity and reproductive justice as they effect people with low incomes, women and LGBTQI+ people of color, and other underserved populations, particularly in the U.S. South.
