The Campaign Manager will work with members of the All* Above All team to advance federal, state, and local policy advocacy, culture change efforts, network development and other strategies that advance medication abortion access at the intersection of economic, immigrant, and racial justice. The Campaign Manager will help create a culture shift in the medication abortion landscape with new frames and messages, develop specific policy strategies that support medication abortion access and reproductive justice, and implement emerging strategies in close coordination with staff, consultants, and network partners. As a member of the All* Above All team, the Campaign Manager will also participate in campaign-wide events and programs as requested. The Campaign Manager will report to
the Campaign Director. 
As we are building the Medication Abortion campaign, we have staffing at the Director and Manager level. The Campaign Manager will be engaged in some of the administrative activities around the campaign until a Campaign Coordinator is added to the team, which is currently planned for 2024.
