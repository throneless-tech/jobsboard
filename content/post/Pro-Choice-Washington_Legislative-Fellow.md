Pro-Choice Washington seeks one fellow to join our organizing team this winter. This program is designed for fellows to gain exposure to political and legislative organizing, volunteer management, and issue-based advocacy. 
The legislative fellow will support Pro-Choice Washington with organizing our annual advocacy week where our activists lobby their lawmakers on our 2023 reproductive freedom agenda. They will also support with in-person legislative activities including in-person testimony, rallies, and in-person lobbying meetings. Finally, the legislative fellow will conduct a community engagement project to support our 2023 legislative priorities and work on a collaborative project that aligns with the fellow’s interests and Pro-Choice Washington’s priorities.
