The Development Associate will be part of a remote team that reports to the Director of Resource Development. As the Development Associate, you will bolster the capacity of the department, with a focus on administrative support and operational capacity. Our goal is to help you grow as a development professional still learning the basics of the field. You will consistently be given tasks that assist colleagues in cultivating relationships with funders. That means youâ€™ll have your finger on the pulse of our existing donor relationships and work while thinking about helping our portfolios grow.
