We are looking for our first Program Operations Coordinator to join the Co-Director for Movement Building and Co-Director for Organizational Development to carry out the day-to-day operations of the organization. With this being an inaugural role some responsibilities may shift and evolve over time as the organization grows; we anticipate that you will co-create this role with the Co-Directors. Current responsibilities include, but are not limited to: executive leadership support, operational systems, administrative support and logistics, and communications.
