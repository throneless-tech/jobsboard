The primary role of the Program Officer (PO) is to work closely with and under the guidance of the Senior Program Officer (SPO) to manage a dynamic portfolio of grants. The PO will play a critical role in taking on end-to-end grant management which will enable the SPO to focus more fully on strategy research and development. The role of the PO is also to provide appropriate thought partnership and support in ongoing strategy development and implementation. They will demonstrate nimbleness, able to pivot and adapt easily to play a continually integral role on a dynamic global team. They will work in alignment with SPO(s) on all aspects of work, demonstrating strong judgment and trustworthiness in stewarding grantee and other relationships on behalf of the foundation. The PO sees themselves as a leader who embraces the opportunity to positively contribute to the team — through curiosity, humility, empathy, and humor — in all facets of their work.
