Background | STBF’s Global Programs (GP) strategy invests in sexual and reproductive health and rights around the world. At the core of our strategy is the central tenet that our funding will lead to permanent change: We want our funding to help build the systems, organizations, and institutions that will outlive our grantmaking, so that women and girls will continue to receive services when our funding comes to an end. In order to deliver on this ambitious strategy, the GP team is expanding thoughtfully, adding strategic and grants management capacity in key areas. Compared to the size of its grant-making, the GP team is small in staff size, though growing globally. We aim to identify opportunities for impact by questioning, piloting, reflecting, learning, and putting learned information to effective use. We are not afraid to fail or change our approach in light of new learnings. We regard our investments as partnerships and regard our grantees as our partners.
Position Description | The primary role of the Program Officer (PO) is to work closely with and under the guidance of the Senior Program Officer (SPO) to manage a dynamic portfolio of grants. The PO will play a critical role in taking on end-to-end grant management which will enable the SPO to focus more fully on strategy research and development. The role of the PO is also to provide appropriate thought partnership and support in ongoing strategy development and implementation. They will demonstrate nimbleness, able to pivot and adapt easily to play a continually integral role on a dynamic global team. They will work in alignment with SPO(s) on all aspects of work, demonstrating strong judgment and trustworthiness in stewarding grantee and other relationships on behalf of the foundation. The PO sees themselves as a leader who embraces the opportunity to positively contribute to the team — through curiosity, humility, empathy, and humor — in all facets of their work.
