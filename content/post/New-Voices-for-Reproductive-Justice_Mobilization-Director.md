The Mobilization Director is a critical member of the Senior Leadership Team at New Voices for Reproductive Justice, responsible for strategically connecting Black women, youth, and gender-expansive people to our organization and the national Reproductive Justice movement. This role oversees both the Community Organizing and Engagement and Voter Engagement Departments, which are pivotal in expanding our base, driving community engagement, and building political power. The Mobilization Director’s primary responsibility is to lead the organization in building concrete power, including increased voter turnout, relationships with elected officials, campaign wins, and organizing achievements. This role will pilot the development and execution of comprehensive mobilization strategies, foster local, statewide, regional, and national partnerships, and ensure the successful implementation of community organizing strategies and integrated voter engagement initiatives and campaigns in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland. We are looking for an expert leader with a high level of either voter engagement or effective community outreach experience to lead our organization’s power-building strategy and efforts.
