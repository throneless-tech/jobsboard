An Associate delivers exceptional customer service and support, a combination of
direct account service and support for the Accounts Team. An Associate is expected
to keep projects on track and on time. Associates help prepare Accounts materials
such as memos and plans, edit and proof direct mail, and coordinate multiple
time-sensitive deliverables across teams and time zones.
