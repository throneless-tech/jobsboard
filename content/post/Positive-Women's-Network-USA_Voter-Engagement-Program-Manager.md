The Voter Engagement Program Manager works to advance the programmatic and strategic growth of the Positive Women’s Network nonpartisan civic engagement program in key priority areas in Colorado and Pennsylvania, with possible expansion to other geographic areas. PWN does integrated voter engagement to build power. This means, we work in a cycle that includes year-round base building, leadership development, voter and base education, supporter ID and engagement, legislative advocacy, engaging policymakers, and voter turnout – instead of just working on turnout during electoral campaign cycles. For 2022, we will be focused on mobilizing during legislative sessions in Colorado and Pennsylvania, as well as field campaigns: voter education, supporter issue ID, and voter turnout in Colorado and Pennsylvania during the primary and general elections. The Voter Engagement Program Manager will help build and execute all of these.
