This is the job for you if you are excited to be in the medical field and are looking to learn medical skills including blood draws and collecting and processing lab samples. You may travel to neighboring health centers up to 20% of the time during training. You have a high school degree, GED or High School Equivalency (HSE) diploma, and want to provide excellent patient care to all no matter what. 
Spanish-speaking candidates strongly preferred, but not required.
