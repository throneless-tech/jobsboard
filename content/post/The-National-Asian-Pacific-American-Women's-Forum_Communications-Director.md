The National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum (NAPAWF) seeks a Communications Director to direct, manage, and implement the organizationâ€™s strategic communications plan. 

With growing attacks on reproductive justice, record pandemic-level unemployment among AAPI women, and rising anti-Asian hate, the Communications Director will thrive in an environment where the week never ends how it begins. The Communication Director enjoys the hustle and understands the value and purpose of a responsive and nimble communications program to inspire, mobilize, and create change.  

This position reports directly to the Chief Communications Officer (CCO) and will manage and grow a communications team that currently includes a digital engagement strategist, PR and marketing consultants.
