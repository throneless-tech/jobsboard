The Health Care Assistant is responsible for the performance of front and back office duties in Planned Parenthood Health Centers. Planned Parenthood Arizona (PPAZ) is Arizona’s largest reproductive health care provider, serving over 34, 000 patients every year. PPAZ also works to educate communities, lead research directly impacting Arizonans; and advocate for access to health care, resources, and democracy regardless of your race, gender, class, orientation, identity, or status.

Given that Arizona could ban abortion with a court decision on any day, working with impacted communities and activated supporters is a keystone of PPAZ’s organizing philosophy: lived experience and the stories that go along with those experiences are invaluable currency when working to educate decision-makers on the impacts of public policy or court decisions like Dobbs that overturned Roe.
