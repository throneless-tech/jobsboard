Amplify seeks an Operations and Administrative Coordinator (OAC) to manage day-to-day organization operations and administrative needs. The OAC will support the Executive Director and Amplify team in a wide variety of projects. The OAC serves as a support to the Board of Directors and senior management teams; organizes and coordinates executive outreach and external relations efforts; and provides internal structure to support Amplifyâ€™s programming and community engagement goals. The OAC must be creative, exceptionally organized, and enjoy working within a small, entrepreneurial, mission-focused, results-driven, and community-oriented environment. The OAC will have the ability to work independently on projects, from conception to completion, and must be able to handle a wide variety of activities and confidential matters with high levels of discretion and impeccable judgment. We are looking for someone who is excited about our mission, has an eye for detail and precision, and the ability to quickly prioritize multiple competing projects.
