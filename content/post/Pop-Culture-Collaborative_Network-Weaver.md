The Pop Culture Collaborative seeks its first Network Weaver, a naturally social, relationship-driven organizer who will work to seed and strengthen relationships, networks, collaboration, and coordination among the many artists, organizers, strategists, researchers, and funders who comprise the Pop Culture Collaborative community. Working across all of the organizationâ€™s program areas, the Network Weaver will create the systems and infrastructure that enable this innovative community to achieve ambitious narrative change goals at mass audience scale, while also leveraging their collective power to advance social justice within their own movements, industries, and sectors.
