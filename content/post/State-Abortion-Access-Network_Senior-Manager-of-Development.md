The Senior Manager of Development is one of two inaugural staff positions, the other is the Managing Director. The successful candidate will report to the Managing Director. The Senior Manager of Development role is an exciting opportunity to expand on SAAN’s early fundraising success (raised $4M+) and help build SAAN’s fund development program, which will fund SAAN’s growth into a robust support services intermediary to fuel a state abortion advocacy movement. 
The ideal candidate is a fund development systems and operations maven who is also passionate about execution and resulting outcomes. SAAN’s Senior Manager of Development will work in partnership with SAAN’s Managing Director, who has deep expertise in principal gifts, corporate philanthropy, and venture capital fundraising, as well as SAAN’s Steering Committee, member Executive Directors, member Boards of Directors, and existing funder ambassadors, who have, collectively, helped SAAN to raise $4M+ since 2021. We seek an individual who will recognize the transformative nature of this role and support the incredible momentum we have generated.
