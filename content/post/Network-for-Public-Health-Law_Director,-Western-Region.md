At the Network for Public Health Law (Network), we believe in the power of public health law and policy to improve lives and make our communities safer, healthier, stronger and more equitable. We know that understanding, navigating, and using law and policy can transform our communities so we work to help public health leaders, policymakers, researchers, educators, advocates, and health care providers do just that.  We are seeking a Region Director to provide strategic and organizational leadership for the Network’s Western Region team. This role is responsible for overseeing the Region’s strategic and sustainability planning, day-to-day operations, legal technical assistance, outreach efforts, and product development activities.
