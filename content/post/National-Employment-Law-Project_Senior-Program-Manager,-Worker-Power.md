You will be a member of our Worker Power team, reporting to the team’s Director. You will work with NELP’s staff of lawyers, policy experts, researchers, and strategic communications experts. You will primarily focus on coordinating and managing a groundbreaking statewide community and government agency partnership—the California Strategic Enforcement Partnership (CSEP), which was formed in 2016 to tackle wage theft in California. Through CSEP, community partners help to identify significant cases, and support workers throughout the process.  Although the position is primarily focused on CSEP at this time, there is an opportunity to expand into other Worker Power team projects and initiatives. The Worker Power team includes the Worker Center Program, as well as housing NELP’s exploratory climate justice work and other work that seeks to ground policy in building worker power and worker engagement.
