BC4U is an Adolescent Family Planning Program that offers free and confidential sexual and reproductive health services to youth in Colorado who are under the age of 25. BC4U is seeking an Advanced Practice Provider (APP) with either a WHNP, FNP or PA degree to work with youth in our clinic. This position will be hired through the University of Colorado's School of Medicine and be 100% clinical.
