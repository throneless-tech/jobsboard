The Client Services Coordinator oversees the life cycle of an advertising campaign and ensures the team is on track to meet all deadlines. Key responsibilities include managing team workflow, providing scheduling for senior staff, monitoring mail delivery, and keeping projects moving in a timely manner. The Client Services Coordinator is responsible for tracking multiple projects, processes, and work between teams. This position works with a west coast based team and should either be based on the west coast or willing to keep west coast hours. This is a full-time, temporary position through Election Day 2024 with competitive salary and excellent benefits. The nature of our business requires long hours during the election cycle and we expect all staff to be flexible in this area. However, Pivot works to ensure all staff maintain a healthy work/life balance.
