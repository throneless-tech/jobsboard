H2399 is a bill introduced before the Massachusetts legislature by State Rep. Lindsay Sabadosa (1st Hampshire District) that would create funding for medication abortion to be provided by public universities' existing health services, improving access to medication abortion for 13 campuses and their approximately 154,000 current undergraduates. AFY is supporting this effort through youth training and organizing on campus, in partnership with current students. Campus Abortion Advocates are on-campus thought leaders and vocal supporters of increased access to abortion for youth on Massachusetts public university campuses. Advocates are paid a monthly stipend of $100 for their time and leadership; they will have access to two Campus Coordinators for support and guidance. Additional training on organizing, legislative process, and medication abortion will be provided by Advocates for Youth. Advocates will work independently for roughly 5 hours a month, and attend at least two of four special events facilitated by AFY, during which meals will be provided (if held in person, TBD). The duration of the Campus Abortion Advocate role is February-November 2022. Initial training for Campus Abortion Advocates will be held virtually the weekend of March 12-13; applicants are expected to attend a majority of this training.
