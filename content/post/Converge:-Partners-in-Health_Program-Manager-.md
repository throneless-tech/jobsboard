Converge: Partners in Access is dedicated to ensuring all people can access high quality reproductive and sexual healthcare when they need it, how they need it and where they live. As the Mississippi and Tennessee grantee of Title X – the only federal Family Planning Program – we collaborate with each state’s public health agency, nonprofit healthcare providers, and community partners to build a healthcare system that places people at the center of sexual and reproductive healthcare. The Program Manager position will serve as the primary point person to Converge’s network of Mississippi Title X-supported health clinics and providers (known as sub-recipients) who receive funding and technical assistance from Converge, ensuring they have the resources and support needed to provide high-quality family planning healthcare.
