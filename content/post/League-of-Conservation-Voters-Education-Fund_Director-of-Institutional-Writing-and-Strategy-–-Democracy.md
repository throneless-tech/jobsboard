The newly created role of Director of Institutional Writing and Strategy – Democracy will significantly increase funding for our democracy work at the state, regional, and federal levels and support the launch of a new Unified Fundraising pilot program. The goal of the Unified program is to combine fundraising between LCVEF and participating state affiliates, resulting in more money from more donors to power the Conservation Voters Movement.
