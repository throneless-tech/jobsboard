The Latina Institute seeks a Florida State Policy Advocate to lead the Florida state policy agenda in coordination with a dynamic team to protect the reproductive health and rights of Latinas and support the development and execution of our advocacy and organizing strategies locally and state-wide. The FL State Policy Advocate, in coordination with the FL state team, prioritizes the needs of the community by identifying and/or creating community-informed policy solutions. As such, this person must be able to analyze state public programs, proposed state legislation and current law as it relates to the community in order to promote the Latina Instituteâ€™s policy and advocacy work in the areas including coverage and access to reproductive healthcare, including abortion, and immigrant health care access and coverage.
