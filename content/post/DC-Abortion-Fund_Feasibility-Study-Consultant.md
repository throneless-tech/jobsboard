DCAF is seeking a consultant to conduct a feasibility study to help us assess the creation of an abortion access hub for the D.C. region. We are looking to partner with someone who is familiar with the local and national abortion access landscape and has ideally worked with or volunteered at an abortion fund or practical support network. The study should: (1) Assess how patients currently access abortion care in the D.C. region; (2) Identify the gaps to accessing care in our region; (3) Examine the effectiveness of other coalitions and organizations that provide wraparound services; (4) Bring in the expertise of local and national partners; and (5) Provide at least two recommendations for how to move forward, including a detailed project plan for each option.
