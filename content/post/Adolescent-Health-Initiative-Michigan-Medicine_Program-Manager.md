The AHI team works to ensure that their interventions promote evidence-based practice and prioritize care for youth across a wide spectrum of identities. This includes, but is not limited to, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender and non-binary youth, youth across intersecting racial identities and experiences, migrant youth, young people across socioeconomic statuses, system-involved youth, young people from all religious backgrounds, expectant or parenting teens, adolescents that have disabilities or identify as disabled, and any identity marker that impacts a young person’s experience as it relates to health. Qualified candidates for this position should be committed to supporting this type of work.

AHI and Michigan Medicine seek to recruit and retain a diverse workforce as a reflection of our commitment to serve the diverse individuals and organizations we work with across the country. We seek to sustain the excellence in our programs and services and to offer our partners richly varied disciplines, perspectives, and ways of knowing and learning.

The AHI Program Manager plays an integral role in furthering AHI’s mission and vision through the development of innovative strategic initiatives and organizational guidance provided through its role on AHI’s Leadership Team. This role is responsible for increasing AHI’s visibility on the national landscape through playing a key part in organizational strategic planning; identifying new business and funding opportunities; planning, coordinating, and writing grant proposals; overseeing grant-funded projects, ensuring deliverables are met on time and with high quality; building and maintaining strong partnerships with local and national partners; and promoting and improving AHI’s programs. The Program Manager plays an active role in identifying opportunities for AHI to present at local and national meetings and conferences and represents AHI on national committees and initiatives. This role provides guidance and support related to AHI’s program offerings, and works to further AHI’s vision, mission, organizational values, and commitment to youth engagement, ensuring programming aligns with each of these priorities.
