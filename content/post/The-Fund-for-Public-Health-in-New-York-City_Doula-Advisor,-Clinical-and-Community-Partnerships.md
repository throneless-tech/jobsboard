Reporting to the MHQIN Program Manager, the Doula Advisor will work with governmental and health care partners, subcontracted programs, and MHQIN to advocate for system-level change to overcome the barriers and challenges to providing doula support in hospitals, as well as developing a doula-friendly accreditation system. The Doula Advisor will also support development of a doula-friendly-hospital toolkit and educational materials, for hospitals unable to receive hands-on technical assistance as part of MHQIN.
