The DC Abortion Fund seeks a Development Director to support its exciting growth and to create a fundraising infrastructure to sustain its impact for the future. Working closely with DCAF’s two Caller Services and Engagement Co-Directors, the Operations & Strategy Director, and the Board, the Development Director serves as a key leader of DCAF, actively cultivating partnerships that advance the organization’s mission while enhancing relationships with all stakeholders, including peer organizations in the reproductive justice space, foundations, individual donors, and business and nonprofit leaders, among others. The Development Director maximizes opportunities for diverse sources of revenue, including but not limited to donor cultivation, grants, events, and planned giving programs, that advance DCAF’s mission and impact and ensure DCAF’s long-term sustainability. The successful candidate will ideally be networked in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia region and be a strong relationship builder and organizational storyteller, who leverages DCAF’s story of impact to build interest in and support for DCAF’s work in the region and beyond.
