The DuPont Clinic is a person-centered, evidence-based referral center for all-trimester abortion care and ultrasound-guided procedures, primarily for management of abnormal and high-risk pregnancies. Our clinic strives to meet the unique needs of each person, ensuring they experience the highest level of privacy, comfort, and compassion. We provide care for patients with complex medical and social backgrounds that may preclude them from being seen elsewhere; each patient is tended to personally by a doula as well as our highly-trained staff of nurses and physicians. We seek an outstanding person to join the DuPont Clinic as a Patient Care Coordinator. As an integral part of our team, this person will work directly with the scheduling team members to speak with people seeking care over the phone, coordinate their travel and funding, and ensure continuity of care with referring providers. The PCC will report to Dupont Clinicâ€™s Program Manager. The typical work schedule will be Monday-Friday, 9AM-5PM. The PCC may be asked to cover occasional shifts on Saturdays as needed.
