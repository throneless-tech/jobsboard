The Institute for Research on Male Supremacism is seeking a remote part-time contractor to support our operations researching and challenging male supremacism. The 40-hour per month, 5-month position (with the possibility for an extension) will support a variety of tasks around administration, finance, fundraising, communications, and program development. We are looking for someone who has prior experience in at least some of these areas and who is a capable and eager learner, able to absorb new information and develop skills in this position. In other words, we welcome applications from candidates who might not have all the suggested qualifications looking for a growth experience, especially candidates from historically and systematically marginalized groups. The Program and Administrative Contractor will primarily report to the Executive Director, and will also work with the Board Treasurer and Chair. T
