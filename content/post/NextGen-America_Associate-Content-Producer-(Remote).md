NextGen America is seeking an Associate Content Producer who is dedicated to producing high-quality content for both online and broadcast use. Candidate must be a talented Jane- or Jack-of-all-trades. Technical responsibilities include visualizing and creating graphics, illustrations, logos, layouts and photos, concepting videos, scripting, lighting, sound, shooting, editing, and delivery on rapid response timelines as short as half a day. The ability to multitask simultaneous video campaigns in a fast-paced environment is essential for this position. Troubleshooting skills are a must. There will also be a heavy dose of photography for digital and social assets.
