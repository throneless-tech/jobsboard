The Executive Assistant is an internal- and external-facing role that provides high-level support in close working relationships with the Executive Director (ED) and Chief Operating Officer (COO). This role serves as a major organizational asset as RAD confronts the challenges of post-Roe abortion access, keeping the ED and COO organized, informed, and prepared. The Executive Assistant also acts as the logistical coordinator and administrative liaison to the boards and committees RAD organizes and convenes, which include RADâ€™s Advisory Board, a coalition of abortion service delivery funders and related working groups, and an advisory committee of key stakeholders from the field. The ideal candidate for this position will be an experienced executive support professional who knows how to make themselves an indispensable resource to their execs. They are an energetic, detail-oriented, multi-tasker who thrives and takes pride in a supporting role.
