Unchained At Last is a survivor-led nonprofit organization dedicated to ending forced and child marriage in the United States through direct services and systems change. 

The Senior Writer and Researcher is a great fit for someone with at least five years of writing experience, at least three years of those being in advocacy communications. We are looking for someone who can make people sob or laugh out loud with the power of their prose and would not be caught dead using a dangling modifier or comma splice. This person will primarily research and write memos, fact sheets, and other materials about the harms of child marriage and forced marriage (with pro bono legal research support from some of the worldâ€™s largest law firms) and compose external communications about the campaign. The salary for this position is $82,000. Find out more and apply here.
