The ACLU seeks applicants for the full-time position of Senior Federal Legislative Counsel in the National Political Advocacy Department, Liberty Division, based in the ACLUâ€™s National office in Washington, D.C. The National Political Advocacy Department (NPAD) works to strengthen the efforts of the ACLU at the federal, state, and local levels of government. The department harnesses the political power that comes from having more than eight million members and supporters, as well as affiliates in every state. Through grassroots organizing, lobbying and policy work, and issue campaigns, the ACLU seeks to achieve change as profound in the legislative, administrative and electoral arenas as it has accomplished through the courts. Reporting to the Deputy Division Director of the Liberty Division, the Senior Federal Legislative Counsel will work with national staff and ACLU affiliates to protect reproductive freedom and combat measures that restrict abortion access. The Senior Policy Counsel will work to further efforts connected to federal legislation and administrative actions on issues that impact reproductive rights and access to abortion.
