Advance Native Political Leadership Action Fund is looking for a National Communications Manager to join our growing team. We are excited to find an emerging leader who can help guide us in moving beyond cookie cutter communications, press, and social media strategies as they have traditionally been done. Do you have a passion for storytelling that fuses political narrative with a community perspective? Can you see the intersections between communications work and digital organizing as a form of community building? This role is right for someone with a talent for creating accessible content around the issues impacting Indian Country, and who is skilled at deconstructing complex stories. If you have experience developing communication strategies that engage our responsibility to our ancestors to build power for future generations, this position might be for you.
