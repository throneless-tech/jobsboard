American Progress is looking for an individual who will help advance a progressive agenda for women’s issues at the state, federal, and local levels, supporting work on a range of issues that will advance access to health care, particularly reproductive health. The candidate should have experience advancing federal and state health care policies through research and writing, engaging with lawmakers, and distilling complicated policy information into social media and other communications. Additionally, the candidate should have project management skills and be able to work across teams, including outside of their primary discipline.
