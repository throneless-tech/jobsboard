Womenâ€™s Link has recently shaped a five-year strategic framework, which focuses on scaling mission impact.  Its strategic pillars center women and girls, focus on setting the agenda, strengthening movements and advocacy and ultimately, increasing awareness and mobilization around using the law in creative and innovative ways to create change. This strategy will continue to be further stress-tested and iterated under the incoming ED as they build their understanding of what works and begin to navigate key strategic questions.  These include appropriate breadth vs. depth of the strategy in key geographies and what scaling impact will mean for organizational growth.
