Working collaboratively within Pregnancy Justice’s legal team, the paralegal supports the work of Pregnancy Justice’s attorneys with a shared mission to provide holistic legal advocacy and litigation services to clients facing pregnancy criminalization, forced medical interventions, and family regulation systems involvement. All Pregnancy Justice employees must embrace, respect and value the rich range of perspectives and experience of a diverse and heterogeneous staff. We recognize and appreciate that our work is better for having varied participants and thought partners. The paralegal will track and maintain the litigation docket for legal team, including pending litigation, consultations, special projects and trainings/presentations and draft reports, including to Board of Directors; draft and format legal documents including routine pleadings and motions, affidavits, and interrogatories; format and file motions and pleadings according to judicial procedures including via electronic case management systems; proofread and edit legal filings and external documents (reports, issue briefs); organize and maintain litigation-related resources, such as expert witness CVs, relevant trial transcripts, research papers, model briefs and motions; prepare materials for court appearances, hearings, and trial, and assist attorneys with hearing and trial preparation, which may include attending trials and hearings; research statutes, regulations, legal articles, judicial decisions, and other legal sources; provide written analysis to attorneys.
