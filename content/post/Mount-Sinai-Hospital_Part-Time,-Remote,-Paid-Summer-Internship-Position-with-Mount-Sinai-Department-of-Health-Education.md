The Mount Sinai Department of Health Education is proud to offer The Public Health and Racial Justice Program, an innovative health education and empowerment program for high-school aged Black youth in NYC. Over the course of a 6-week, fully remote session, participants learn about the expansive field of public health through a racial justice lens, and explore the roles that Black leadership and Black activism play in fighting against oppression and for greater health equity. A group of ten youth program participants meet each morning under the guidance of four program facilitators, Monday through Thursday, from 10-11:30am, engaging in learning, critical analysis, civic engagement, creative expression, emotional processing, and reflection. Itâ€™s important that all of our program staff, including our interns, have deep connections and experience with the people and movements our work in this program supports. As such, we especially seek applications from individuals who identify as Black. The pay for this position is an hourly rate of $15/hour, at ten hours per week, for a total of seven weeks (6/27-8/18).
