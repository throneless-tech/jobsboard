We Testify is hiring a bilingual Communications Manager to support the voices of abortion storytellers in media and the movement, elevate the organization’s vision of culture shift through innovative campaigns and social media, and maintain the organization’s brand identity. The Communications Manager’s role includes supporting people who’ve had abortions to connect deeper to their experiences while deciding which parts of their stories they’d like to share with the world. You’ll chat with reporters to help them understand who has abortions and why, and ensure that media coverage of abortion storytellers is accurate and reflective of our actual experiences. The Bilingual Communications Manager will dream up visionary digital campaigns, in English and in Spanish, that reflect our abortion experiences and challenge the people who love us to think deeper about our full spectrum of experiences.
