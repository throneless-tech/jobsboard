While nurses provide most of the reproductive and sexual health care services in the United States, this content is under-represented in nursing education and continuing education. In response to these identified needs, NSRH has developed an Online Institute consisting of modules and webinars and a Resource Library of external SRH training and information for nurses. These resources provide both student nurses and professional nurses  with the education that is missing from current nursing programs and postgraduate education. Additionally, NSRH was recently awarded a substantial grant through the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) as a part of the Reproductive Health Services Corps. The purpose of the RHSC is to develop and/or update current curricula to provide reproductive health care training, including abortion care to various health care professionals throughout the state of California. Our organization is seeking an Instructional Design Manager to lead the on-going growth, content development and impact of the Online Institute and NSRH Resource Library. This position will also support other Education Department endeavors.
