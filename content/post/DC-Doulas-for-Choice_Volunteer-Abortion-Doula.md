The DC Doulas for Choice Collective is a DC-based, volunteer-led-and-run organization that seeks to provide doula care to people across the full spectrum of reproductive realities. As of right now, we currently only provide abortion doula services to two DMV area clinics, based in Falls Church, VA and NE Washington, DC. As a member of the collective, you would be required to take at least one 3-5 hour abortion doula shift per month (of course with some flexibility, and the hope that you take more!). Additionally, being a member of the collective comes with various other responsibilities and opportunities.
