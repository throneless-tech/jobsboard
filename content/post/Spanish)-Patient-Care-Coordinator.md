Seeking an abortion can be a stressful experience for many reasons - individuals are faced with stigma, may lack resources, and are facing a constantly changing legal landscape. Our office is looking for an individual to help people break through these barriers to access the healthcare they need. As a Patient Care Coordinator, you would be the initial point of contact for potential patients and their families.
