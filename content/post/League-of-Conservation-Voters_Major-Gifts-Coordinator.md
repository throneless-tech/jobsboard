LCV is hiring a Major Gifts Coordinator to support our major gifts fundraising program. Our fast-paced and dynamic major gifts team is working to engage new and existing five- and six-figure donors in LCV's efforts to fight climate change and protect our environmental safeguards. The Major Gifts Coordinator will help prepare and organize the team so they can reach their fundraising goals. Responsibilities include coordinating internal and external meetings, maintaining a content library of documents and materials that effectively communicate LCV's work to donors, including our work on racial justice and equity, creating and updating reports that track fundraising progress, tailoring donor communications and proposals and updating database records, among other duties. The Major Gifts Coordinator position is critical to supporting a robust fundraising program and an opportunity for someone who wants to learn more about fundraising and nonprofit work.
