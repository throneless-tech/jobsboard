The Voice Your Vote! (VYV) Community Outreach Coordinator is a member of the VYV Team and is responsible for providing key leadership in implementing our voter engagement program in Pennsylvania to build power among Black women, queer folks, and marginalized individuals who are either unregistered or infrequent voters. The VYV Community Outreach Coordinator is key in connecting this voter base to the local and national  Reproductive Justice movement. The selected candidate will represent the interests of New Voices and our constituents in various settings through voter engagement coalitions, partnerships, and alliances and will be required to travel as needed to support the goals of the organization.
