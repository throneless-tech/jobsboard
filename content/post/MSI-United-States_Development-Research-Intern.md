MSI United States (MSI US) promotes and supports the mission of MSI Reproductive Choices to provide sexual and reproductive healthcare to millions of underserved women and girls around the world. The Development Research Intern will help conduct a donor behavior research project designed to help us better understand the philanthropic priorities of supporters giving under $1,000 annually. The right candidate will have the opportunity to shape the research questions and outcomes under the supervision of the Development Officer and will spend the majority of the internship calling supporters by phone to thank them for their generosity and to conduct brief interviews. This role is anticipated to start by early June and continue through late August. The preferred schedule is to work approximately 10-12 hours/week across 2-3 days/week.
