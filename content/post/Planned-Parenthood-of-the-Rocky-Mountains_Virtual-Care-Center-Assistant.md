Snapshot:
Most of your time will be spent on the computer in a virtual environment interacting with patients. You may work from home or the office. You may be required to be in the office occasionally for administrative duties, training, or team building. As non-licensed staff, you will assist in patient telehealth appointments for patients, collecting patient information, processing payments, obtaining informed consent, and providing education when appropriate. You will address patient concerns within your scope as outlined by PPRM policy, transferring patients to the appropriate team member as necessary. Patient care will be timely, empathetic, and accurate.
