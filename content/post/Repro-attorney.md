The ACLU of Southern California is hiring an attorney to work on LGBTQ, Gender & Reproductive Justice. Folks can read the job description and apply here. 

Our team uses an integrated advocacy approach to advocate for reproductive justice, gender equity, and LGBTQ lived equality. Our current projects range from a pregnancy and lactation discrimination lawsuit on behalf of dockworkers at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, to technical assistance for community activists defending trans rights and LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum in public schools in the Central Coast region, to working with the DecrimSexWorkCA coalition to implement its recent legislative win (eliminating “loitering with intent”) and build toward full decriminalization of consensual sex work in California.

We anticipate hiring someone with 4-8 years of legal experience, including litigation experience. This is a bargaining-unit position (NOLSW Local 2320). The job entails some in-person work (e.g. court appearances and coalition convenings) around SoCal, and the organization requires all new staff to be residents of California, but it is also piloting a generous and flexible policy whereby employees choose whether and when to work from an office. And it’s hard to succinctly describe a culture, but the majority of this team opted into dressing as Taylor Swift albums for Halloween.
