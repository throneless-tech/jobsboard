ORGANIZATIONAL BACKGROUND

Resilience is an independent, not‐for‐profit organization dedicated to the healing and empowerment of sexual assault survivors through non‐judgmental crisis intervention counseling, individual and group trauma therapy, and medical and legal advocacy in the greater Chicago metropolitan area. Resilience provides public education and institutional advocacy in order to improve the treatment of sexual assault survivors and to effect positive change in policies and public attitudes toward sexual assault. Established in 1974, Resilience now serves over 2000 survivors of sexual violence and their loved ones annually through our main office in downtown Chicago and our community‐based offices in Austin and Ravenswood, and several co-locations within partner organizations across the city.

GENERAL ROLE DESCRIPTION

This position also plans and executes community mobilization and social justice activism campaigns, including overseeing the OurMusicMyBody (OMMB) campaign with the support of the Prevention Educator/OMMB Campaign Coordinator. 

Resilience prevention work is feminist, anti-racist, and victim-centered and recognizes the systems of privilege within our culture, the impact of oppression, and the intersections of oppressions in survivor identities and communities.
