We are living through a pivotal moment for abortion access—and the telemedicine clinic Hey Jane is uniquely positioned to help. But only 1 in 4 adults even knows that abortion pills are an option for having a safe, discreet abortion. We’re looking for a brilliant social media and community manager who can spread awareness and tell the Hey Jane story—with an eye towards the future as we launch new services and expand beyond abortion care—through social media and our community programs. Think: A natural storyteller who is fluent in memes, passionate about creating welcoming virtual spaces, and adept at being able to report back on it all—with a knack for making impactful, educational, and extremely viral content.
