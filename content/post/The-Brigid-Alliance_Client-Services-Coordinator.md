The Brigid Alliance seeks to add three passionate, diligent, and collaborative Client Services Coordinators to its remote team to help the organization enter its next phase of growth, beckoned by an increasing need for travel support among abortion seekers in the US. The Client Services Coordinators are part of a remote-based team that reports to the Director of Client Services. The team works closely to plan case management and coordinate communication directly with clients, clinics, abortion funds, and other practical support organizations.
