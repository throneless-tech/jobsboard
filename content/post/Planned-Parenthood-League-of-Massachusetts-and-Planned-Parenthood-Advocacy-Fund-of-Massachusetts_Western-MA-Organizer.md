The Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (PPLM) and the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts (PPAF) seek an organizer based in Western MA, with a dedicated focus on, but not limited to, Hampden County. We are looking for a dynamic, fired up individual who cares about equitable access to reproductive care and believes in empowering and building community. This Organizer is responsible for supporting the execution of a statewide strategy to harness the energy of supporters across the Commonwealth, growing the organization’s base, and working directly with volunteer leaders. They will develop relationships with PPAF supporters and community organizations, and ensure that consistent engagement opportunities exist for supporters across the state and in the region to feel empowered to take collective action in support of Planned Parenthood’s legislative, electoral, and reproductive health work. This work includes legislative and electoral organizing, volunteer leadership development, youth organizing, and supporting regional execution of statewide constituency organizing programs. This role will also be instrumental in the PPLM/PPAF strategic plan’s focus on establishing equitable access to HIV prevention, care, and education in Springfield.
