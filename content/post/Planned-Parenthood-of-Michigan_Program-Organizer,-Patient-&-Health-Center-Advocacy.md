The Patient & Health Center Advocacy programs are Planned Parenthoodâ€™s national effort to work with Patients & Health Centers on increasing involvement in sex education, sexual and reproductive health advocacy and increasing access care. Planned Parenthood of Michigan is seeking a program organizer to build sustainable relationships with patients and health centers to enlist abortion storytellers that could organize their own community for sexual and reproductive health & abortion access. Successful candidates will ensure the centering of patients and health centers in the reproductive health and abortion access narrative, engage Patient & Health Center leaders and storytellers, and support communities to advocate for sexual and reproductive healthcare and abortion access.
