The Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) is part of the clinical team that provides procedural abortion, male sterilization, and other minor gynecologic procedures in accordance with Planned Parenthood of Illinoisâ€™ policies, protocols, and procedures in the PPIL Medical Standards and Guidelines.
 
A CRNA allows Planned Parenthood of Illinois to provide sedation for patients undergoing procedures. The ability to provide sedation is an important part of providing compassionate care, especially in Illinois where patients may have travelled long distances to obtain services.
 
The job position as a 1099 contract employee allows for flexibility with scheduling. Clinics have nontraditional surgery hours, which can allow for work/life balance.
