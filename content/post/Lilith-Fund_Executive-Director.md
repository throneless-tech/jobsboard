Lilith Fund is seeking a highly-skilled, senior-level, bold leader to take on the role of Executive Director (ED) in Austin, Houston, or San Antonio, Texas. The ED will bring an audacious vision for working collectively toward reproductive justice, approach challenges with a curious and creative mindset, embrace collaborative practices, and demonstrate a commitment to operationalizing racial justice and anti-racism. The ED will have strategic and operational responsibility for leading LF in a hostile political climate as our movement continues to navigate a post-Roe reality where abortion access is banned in Texas.
