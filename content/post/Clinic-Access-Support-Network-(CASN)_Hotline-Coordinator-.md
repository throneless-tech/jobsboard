Clinic Access Support Network (CASN) is a grassroots network of volunteers who provide transportation, lodging, and compassionate care to patients seeking abortion care in Houston.

We are hiring a Hotline Coordinator to connect our callers to funding and practical support needed to get to their abortions. The Hotline Coordinator will respond to requests for assistance coming through intake channels and coordinate services and funding, as applicable.
