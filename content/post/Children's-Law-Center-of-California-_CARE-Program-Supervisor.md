Join Children’s Law Center of California (CLC) and become part of a fantastic team of advocates serving high-need clients within our Child Advocacy Resource Effort (CARE) Program! CLC is the largest children’s legal services organization in the nation, currently serving 33,000 clients in the Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Placer County child welfare systems. The CARE Program provides a collaborative and intensive legal representation and service delivery model to some of CLC’s most high-need clients, including those with high-end mental health needs, youth involved in the juvenile justice system, and those who have been trafficked. Program staff work directly with youth and emerging adult clients in and outside of the courtroom, and collaborate with a cross sector of child welfare, workforce, educational, and other community and county agencies to ensure transition-age youth have access to necessary resources and services to prepare for life after foster care.
