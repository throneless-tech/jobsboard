Faith in Public Life (FPL) and Faith in Public Life Action(FPLA),our sister organization, advance the moral imperative for a just, inclusive, and equitable country that allows each of us to live into our full humanity and advocate for policies that protect and advance our sacred human rights.

Our national coalition and state cohorts of influential faith leaders–who reflect the diversity of the nation–collectively discern the direction of their work, set faith-forward strategy, and take transformative action.

Our coalition and cohorts help move our two core campaign focus areas: promoting/expanding reproductive health & equity and preventing/combating political violence.

By building cultures of belonging, leveraging the collective power of our multi-faith and multi-racial coalition and cohorts, and advocating for policies that protect the full humanity of each of us, FPL/A seeks to move us all closer to realizing a healthy and equitable democracy.
