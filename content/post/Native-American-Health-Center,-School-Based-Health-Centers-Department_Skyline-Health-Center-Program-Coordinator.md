We're seeking a bright, motivated, and detail-oriented individual to work closely with the Program Manager, School Administration, and the SBHC dept. towards improving the health status of students at Skyline High School. The PCI will be responsible for providing health center coordination, project planning, and administrative support for the Health Center.
