This RFP is for design and development services for a new website for the DC Abortion Fund. DCAF has gone through a lot of change in the past year, including the transition from a volunteer-led organization to one with five full-time staff members. We will be launching a new logo and brand identity this calendar year, and we will need a paired website that clearly communicates who we are to the public. DCAF’s current website is outdated in appearance, structure, functionality, and content presentation. We are looking for a website that is dynamic, colorful, joyful, and easy to navigate—both for the user and for staff—and looking for a pro-abortion individual or agency to produce it! Please refer to the RFP link for more information, and we look forward to your proposal.
