At Women’s Democracy Lab, we envision a world liberated, where we can live safely as our whole and authentic selves, grounded in our unique histories, identities, and stories. Our mission is to radically reimagine what leadership looks like and ensure Indigenous women and women of color can thrive in elected office. Women’s Democracy Lab is looking for a part-time, remote Program Associate to support its programmatic work. The ideal individual will have strong written and verbal communication, administrative and organizational skills, and the ability to maintain a balance among multiple priorities. The associate must be collaborative and solutions-oriented with a demonstrated commitment to the mission of Women’s Democracy Lab. As the organization grows, Women’s Democracy Lab commits to work together throughout the year to review the position’s part-time hours and workload.
