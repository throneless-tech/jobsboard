The Web Manager will make PRH’s mission and work accessible to the public and supporters by overseeing PRH’s public facing brand via prh.org. This is accomplished by updating, maintaining, and revamping our website, prh.org. The Web Manager will respond to the real time needs of PRH’s organizational work, highlighting press hits, updating the site with press releases and features of PRH’s latest policy work and blogs, and ensuring PRH’s site content is up to date and accurate. They will work closely with PRH’s Voice and Communications team, collaborating with Digital Strategist to align PRH’s brand and voice across digital platforms. They will oversee the security of the site and will serve as project manager as we embark on a redesign and launch of a new website.
