At SRJ, we see our role in the community as facilitators who support the leadership and expertise of our community to develop solutions rooted in a reproductive justice framework. We are searching for someone to join our team who will be committed to our goals of SRJ being a tool for the communities who are most impacted to create their own solutions. SRJ seeks someone who will manage our growing team of organizers, whose goals are to work alongside community members to create solutions that have an intersectional analysis of race and gender. As the Organizing Director at Surge, they will support the organizing team with building and implementing campaigns that are rooted in anti-racist principles. They will also develop the leadership within the organizing team, and support and hold organizers accountable to campaign plans and work plan goals. The Organizing Director will work closely with the Executive Director and Policy Director to ensure that the organizing strategy is being implemented.
