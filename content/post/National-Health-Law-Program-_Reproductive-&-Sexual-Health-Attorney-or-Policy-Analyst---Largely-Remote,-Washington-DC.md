We are seeking a full time, experienced Attorney or Policy Analyst for our Washington DC office. The position will involve a broad range of advocacy on Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and other low-income health care programs, primarily through a reproductive health lens. The ideal candidate will have working knowledge of the Medicaid program at the national or state level and have experience as a reproductive and sexual health advocate. This candidate will think proactively and strategically and respond quickly to changing circumstances; have an interest in and willingness to listen and learn in partnership with state advocates; demonstrate strong leadership, communication, research, and writing skills; and be able to work individually and in teams. The Attorney or Policy Analyst will help to develop and implement NHeLP's legal, policy, and advocacy strategies for advancing access to quality reproductive and sexual health services, including a particular focus, at least in the foreseeable future, on contraceptive access strategies. The ideal candidate will have experience working within communities of color and will demonstrate an understanding of the issues of contraceptive equity and reproductive justice as they impact low-income people, women of color, and other underserved populations.
