The Bilingual Patient Care Guide (PCG) serves as an integral part of the team, creating a supportive patient experience and ensuring patient safety. PCGs provide unique and extremely valuable care for patients while working in conjunction with physicians, advanced practice clinicians, and nurses. The PCG will report directly to the Associate Manager, Patient Care. The PCG provides critical informational, emotional, and physical support for patients during their procedures and recovery, as well as assisting clinicians and administrative staff with clinic operations. The hours for this position are variable four days a week (Mon-Thurs or Tues-Fri), depending on the clinic schedule. PCGs are expected to work about 32 hours a week, with some late nights and on-call 1-2 weeks in the month.
