Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio seeks two dynamic, experienced fund-development team members to serve as Major Gifts Officers in Central and Northeast Ohio. The individuals in these positions are charged to identify, cultivate, solicit, and steward major donors in an assigned regional portfolio. The Major Gifts Officers also establish and provide strategic direction in community engagement and the creation of Affinity Groups. The Major Gifts Officers have an opportunity to make a significant difference in the lives of thousands of Ohioans who rely on Planned Parenthood for affordable, affirming health care.
Timing constitutes a tremendous opportunity for the in-coming Major Gifts Officers as access to reproductive and gender-affirming care is under attack. The Major Gifts Officers will work at a regional level to steward and retain donors at the $10,000 level and above while working with the development operations team to identify, cultivate, and engage new supporters. They will maintain an individual, regional portfolio of donors and work with development leadership to establish and manage affinity groups to deepen the understanding, commitment, and support of donors in their target region.
