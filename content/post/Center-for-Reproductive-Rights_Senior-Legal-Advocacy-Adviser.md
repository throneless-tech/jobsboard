Reporting to the Senior Director for Global Advocacy, the Senior Global Advocacy Adviser in Washington DC, will play an important role in engaging the US government in support of our global advocacy agenda, including building political will to advance SRHR in multilateral spaces. The Senior Global Advocacy Adviser will also work to support the Center’s US foreign policy engagement, build strong relationships and position the Center as a technical expert across relevant USG agencies, Congress and the Administration, and create bridges across policy-making discussions and processes in Washington D.C., at the UN and with governments around the world in support of human rights protections for SRHR.  This position is based in the Center’s Washington, D.C. office. The position is term-limited for two years with a possibility of extension.
