Reporting to the Director of Strategy and Engagement, the Senior Advisor for External Communications will work in partnership with the Senior Advisor for Program Communications, to lead and implement WomenStrong’s communications activities. WomenStrong’s communications goal is to elevate both its own work, providing technical support, grants, and a learning community to its grantee partners, and the work of those partners themselves. Therefore, we see both Senior Advisors, one for External Communications and one for Program Communications, working very closely together. The Senior Advisor for External Communications, specifically, is responsible for the development and implementation of a cohesive external visibility strategy that positions WomenStrong before peer organizations, funders, the media, and other influencers.
