The Law, Rights, and Religion Project (LRRP) at Columbia Law School is hiring an Associate Director to spearhead writing, education, and advocacy at the intersection of religious liberty and reproductive rights, health, and justice. The position will enhance LRRPâ€™s broader mission to advocate for religious liberty and pluralism. The incumbent will report to the director of the Law, Rights, and Religion Project. While LRRP collaborates closely on project development and strategy, the Associate Director will be responsible for executing writing and other projects independently.
