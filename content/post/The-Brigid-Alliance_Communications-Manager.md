The Brigid Alliance seeks to add a Communications Manager to centralize and standardize our operations while increasing collaboration and leveraging opportunities during a period of significant growth beckoned by an increasing need for travel support among abortion seekers in the US. The Communications Manager will work closely with the Development and Programs teams, as well as consultants. The Communications Manager will be part of a remote team that reports to the Senior Director of External Relations. As the Communications Manager you will bolster the capacity of the department, with a focus on leveraging our unique perspective and expertise to increase public understanding and recognition of our work while deepening collaboration across teams.
