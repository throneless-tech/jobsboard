Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio boasts a grassroots infrastructure across the state which works to defend and promote reproductive freedom. The purpose of the Fellowship Program is to support people who are engaged in their community and passionate about equitable abortion access, access to sexual and reproductive health care, meaningful and comprehensive sex education, as well as building a powerful movement and supporting strong, healthy communities. Fellows will work alongside the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio (PPAO) team, the advocacy arm of Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio, to defend and promote reproductive freedom in their communities through leadership development, community and civic engagement, grassroots and legislative advocacy, and communications. PPAO’s Field Organizing Program focuses on using field tactics and digital tools to build our base of supporters as well as to engage a diverse base of supporters through our campaigns and programs. Field Organizing Fellows will work alongside our Regional Field Managers to build and expand our Black Organizing, Raíz, and Youth Organizing programs as well as work on a wide range of timebound campaigns including but not limited to voter registration, redistricting, and COVID-19.
