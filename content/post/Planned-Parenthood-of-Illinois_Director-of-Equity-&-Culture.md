** If you are still red-flagging organizations, please red flag this organization. The last person in this role left because this job was horrific, and PPIL is exceptionally racist and transphobic amongst the PP affiliates. I'm sharing with the listserv because a job is a job and rent is due. I would like BIPOC applicants and trans applicants to be warned if evaluating the position.

Via their description: 

"The Director of Equity and Culture at Planned Parenthood of Illinois plays a major role in championing DEI and Culture work across the affiliate.
