The BlueGreen Alliance (BGA) seeks qualified candidates for the position of California State Policy Organizer (CSPO). The successful candidate will work remotely from California (CA) and be available for regular travel to/in the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento area. The CSPO will report to the CA State Policy Manager under the direction of the Western States Director.
The BlueGreen Alliance (BGA) is a powerful and unified voice for building an economy that addresses climate change, protects the health of people and the environment, eliminates income and racial disparities, and creates and maintains good-paying, union jobs in communities across the country. BGA brings together labor unions and environmental organizations—representing millions of members and supporters—around a shared agenda and enacts change by advocating at the state and federal level; providing education and engaging union members and environmentalists; and communicating the benefits of this shared agenda for working people, their families, and their communities.
