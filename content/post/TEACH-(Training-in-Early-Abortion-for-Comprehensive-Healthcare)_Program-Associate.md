TEACH seeks an energetic and enthusiastic Program Associate to support TEACH’s clinical training operations at local Planned Parenthood Affiliates and Women’s Health Specialists by scheduling 70+ clinicians, facilitating credentialing, organizing initial and ongoing clinical evaluations at each site, and providing administrative and programmatic support. Although working primarily independently, the Program Associate will work closely with the Program Manager and Executive Director, part-time physician colleagues including 20+ trainers, the TEACH Advisory Board, and multiple staff members from two local Planned Parenthood affiliates and Women’s Health Specialists. The Program Associate will be the hub of communication between TEACH trainers, the residency training programs, and Planned Parenthood and Women’s Health Specialists to help ensure smooth collaboration between parties. The right candidate will have opportunities to expand his/her responsibilities within the organization, learn new skills, and offer creative new programming and evaluation ideas.
