We are looking for talented staff managers to run face-to-face (F2F) fundraising offices. A F2F Office Director is responsible for managing and training a staff of paid fundraisers to hit ambitious membership and fundraising goals. The ideal candidate is eager to get hands-on experience with staff development, fundraising, team building and project management. Featured Partner - Planned Parenthood Wisconsin. Women's reproductive rights are under attack. This session, the US Supreme Court is going to decide on a case that is a director challenge to Roe v. Wade - putting abortion access at risk across the nation. Women, not the courts and lawmakers, should decide what is best for themselves and their families. Our campaign will be rallying support for Planned Parenthood Wisconsin to make sure state's laws will protect access to abortion care regardless of who is on the Court.
