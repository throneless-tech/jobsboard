The Director of Movement Partnership will ensure that gender justice and progressive movement partners are fully integrated into PPFAâ€™s core campaigns on sexual and reproductive health, shape core campaigns from an external, power-building point of view, and ensure that PPFA is in a strong relationship to partners who can help build a durable movement circle rooted in trust and reciprocity that achieves gender justice and democracy rights, with particular focus for people from BIPOC communities. In particular, this role will facilitate and organize national progressive partners, including but not limited to focusing on gender justice, democracy, and elections. Internally, this role will work across other verticals in OEC, cross-departmentally on PCA and beyond, and with the Office of the President to develop long-term movement strategies and lead special projects as needed.
