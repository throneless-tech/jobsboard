Every Body Texas is seeking a Project Assistant to lead and support its EC for Every Body project. Every Body Texas used a portion of Title X special funds to launch the EC for Every Body project on February 16, 2022. This project created online resources for people across the state to learn where they could access free or low-cost emergency contraception (EC) in their area. Every Body Texas also hosts a “repro kit” request form on its website where anyone in Texas can submit a request to receive a repro kit by mail.
