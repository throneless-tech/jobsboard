Movement labs is hiring for the role of Digital Director for the 2024 cycle. This role is a mission critical position for our Political Innovation Incubator - it leads execution for any political innovation idea that involves implementing any digital paid media.

This role will be responsible for moving dozens of ideas through the process of vetting, scoping and project planning and piloting them to assess if they have the potential to net over 1000 votes across the seven battleground states. If pilots are successful, work includes scaling those ideas up ahead of the 2024 election. This role will report to and work closely with the VP of Political Innovation.

This role will oversee several pilot projects. One example: Online Voter Registration - targeting different unregistered universes with digital ads to see if they’re more likely to register to vote if we send them to the government’s online voter registration  site versus sending them to our Movement Labs registration portal. This role will be responsible for quickly testing the effectiveness and feasibility of such programs and then scaling up those that prove most effective.
