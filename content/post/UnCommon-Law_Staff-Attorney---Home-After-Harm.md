Staff Attorneys at UnCommon Law are responsible for the provision of legal services to clients and participants across a range of representation modalities, including direct representation in parole hearings; consultation management and delivery; habeas and other litigation; and legal services offered through Home After Harm and related in-prison workshops. Staff Attorney time allocation across these areas of representation varies greatly depending on role and team.



This position will maintain a small caseload of parole hearing representation clients; however, the primary responsibilities of this position will be acting as the lead on providing limited scope legal services to program participants and facilitating legal workshops about the discretionary parole process. This role will support the HAH team in improving, implementing and delivering workshops in both Home After Harm institutions (CSP-LAC and Salinas Valley State Prison) and other prisons across the state.



The Home After Harm Staff Attorney will be a part of a team of advocates, counselors and attorneys supporting Home after Harm participants in navigating the discretionary parole process, including supporting those participants in developing new self-narratives to heal from past trauma. The HAH Staff Attorney will be trained in UCL’s unique, trauma-informed approach to representation and have the opportunity to make a meaningful impact on a harmful, ineffective system. This position will be based near the site of Home After Harm’s SoCal institution, California State Prison, Los Angeles County in Lancaster, CA, which requires the attorney to be in the Los Angeles Area. 



This full-time position is exempt, based in Los Angeles or the Bay Area, and has a salary of $80,970 for applicants with under 5 years post Bar experience. Applicants with over 5 years of experience are eligible for a higher salary of $91,140. This role will mostly work remotely, with some in-prison work (CSP-Los Angeles County in Lancaster, and other institutions as needed) and some required travel to the Bay Area for team events and training. Mileage to and from California state prisons (or other off-site locations) will be reimbursed from your home location.
