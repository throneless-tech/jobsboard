African Services' Women’s Health program works to reframe sexual health within the context of the lived experience of African and Caribbean immigrants’ lives, including but not limited to; immigration, trauma, FGM, pregnancy, menopause, homelessness, poverty, and IPV.  Holistic in its approach, the Women’s Health program acknowledges the multi-faceted aspects of immigrant women’s’ lives, including race, gender, sexuality, sexual pleasure, motherhood and the social determinants contributing to the very real racial health disparities that directly impact their mental health and survival. The Program Coordinator is responsible for program goal development and implementation, supervision of program Peer Navigators, coordination with internal and external program and service referrals, cultivation of community partners and messengers, planning and co-facilitation of group sessions.
