We seek an outstanding person to join the DuPont Clinic as a Patient Care Coordinator. As an integral part of our team, this person will work directly with scheduling team members to speak with people seeking care over the phone, coordinate their travel and funding, and ensure continuity of care with referring providers. The PCC will report to Dupont Clinicâ€™s Managers of Care Coordination. 
This position will primarily support patients scheduling at the DuPont Clinic Los Angeles location once it opens up for care in Fall 2023. Until then, the PCC will schedule patients coming to the Washington, DC location. The anticipated work schedule will be Monday-Friday, 9AM-5PM EST for DC scheduling (through August 2023) and 9AM-5PM PST for LA scheduling (tentatively September/October 2023). The PCC may be asked to cover occasional four-hour shifts on Saturdays as needed.
