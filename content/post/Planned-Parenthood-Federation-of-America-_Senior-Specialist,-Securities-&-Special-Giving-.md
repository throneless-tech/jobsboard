Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and Planned Parenthood Action Fund seek a dedicated Sr. Specialist Securities Program to oversee donations through various financial security vehicles, such as Stocks and Donor Advised Funds. This role reports to the Director, Retention Marketing & Donor Services in the Direct Response department of PPFA. The Direct Response department raises funds up to $25,000 from individuals through mail, telemarketing, canvassing, and online solicitations. The Securities program is an important part of Planned Parenthood’s fundraising portfolio, and has grown significantly in recent years. Donations via securities can only be directed to Planned Parenthood’s 501(c)(3) entities, and not to the Action Fund.
