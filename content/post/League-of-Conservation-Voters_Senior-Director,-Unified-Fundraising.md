LCV is hiring a Senior Director, Unified Fundraising who will be responsible for the implementation of a new fundraising pilot program to foster successful fundraising collaboration between LCV and a select group of state affiliates. The goal of Unified Fundraising is to combine fundraising between LCV and participating state affiliates, resulting in more money from more donors to power the Conservation Voters Movement. Fundamental to this effort is the opportunity to pursue anti-racist fundraising.
