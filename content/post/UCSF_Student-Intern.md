ANSIRH is seeking two students to work closely with faculty and staff on our Abortion Facility Database. The student interns will be responsible for updating ANSIRHâ€™s national database of abortion-providing facilities and the internship will continue until completion of the update. The database was last updated in Summer 2020. The work will entail conducting a systematic online search based on established methodology, and making mystery calls to facilities to gather information that is not available online. The student interns will work within a multi-disciplinary team. ANSIRH values a diverse workforce and strongly encourages applications from candidates who are people of color or have otherwise been historically excluded in abortion research.
