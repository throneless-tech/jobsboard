We are seeking a Senior Communications Associate to join our energetic communications team. Our team works to bring voice to the issues of the National Partnership, with the belief that media is an extremely powerful tool for improving the lives of women. We also believe that in this fast-paced media environment, the lines between traditional, social and digital media are increasingly blurring and that skilled communications professionals must be able to master both.
