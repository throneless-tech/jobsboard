Tapestry’s fundamental value is that compassionate, culturally competent, and dignified healthcare is a human right. We recognize the injustice that underlies health disparities, and that people face immense barriers to care based on their unique circumstances — income, race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, where they live, history of trauma, and several other factors.

Building upon Tapestry’s history as a trusted provider delivering innovative, high-quality and stigma-free healthcare, this individual will provide direction to Tapestry’s staff and board in executing upon the recently completed strategic plan while continuing to position the organization as a leading expert in the field.
