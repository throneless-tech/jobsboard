We are seeking a dynamic, motivated and experienced director of health equity and reform to lead TCF’s health care team and help shape a more equitable, accessible American health care system. The director will oversee a team of researchers working on health equity, black maternal health, reproductive justice and abortion access, and universal coverage. They will set the direction for TCF’s health policy work going forward, devise political strategies to influence policymakers and opinion leaders in the field, and produce their own original research and writing to change and reshape health care policy for the better. The right candidate will bring extensive policy and research skills, a network of relevant contacts in public policy, press and philanthropy, and a sophisticated approach to examining public policy through an intersectional equity lens.
