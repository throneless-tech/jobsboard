We are looking to hire additional data managers in preparation for the Supreme Court ruling set to be announced in the coming months. Pending the decision, we foresee major changes to abortion access nationwide. Responsibilities include confirming incoming data submissions from varying sources, monitoring clinic closures, updating clinic information, and updating state specific alerts. While we never require a minimum number of hours per week, we do ask that expectations for your commitment be set two weeks in advance. Experience within the reproductive justice and/or abortion access space is preferred but not required. Experience with Airtable and Slack is highly preferred.
