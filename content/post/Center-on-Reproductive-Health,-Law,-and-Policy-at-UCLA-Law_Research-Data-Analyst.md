The UCLA Law Center for Reproductive Health, Law and Policy Data Analyst will conduct and support social science, public health, and public policy research to advance the mission of the center in close collaboration with the center's other scholars. The UCLA Law Center on Reproductive Health, Law and Policy is dedicated to training the next generation of researchers, lawyers, and leaders dedicated to advancing reproductive rights and producing research-informed strategies to transform current debates. As a national interdisciplinary academic center, the center will amplify UCLA Law's current work on reproductive health, law and policy and build capacity by attracting new leaders, scholars and students.
Primary responsibilities include managing project timelines, research materials, and data, developing research protocols, study materials, preparation of human subjects applications, data collection and analysis, and preparing written products (literature reviews, reports, manuscripts, grant proposals, fact sheets, graphics, presentations, and so forth.) Participation in center meetings, seminars, educational events, and other meetings, as determined by the research supervisor, is required.
