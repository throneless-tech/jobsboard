The Patient Navigator - Surgical Services provides case management services directly to patients seeking abortion care at PPGOH. This includes but is not limited to working with the clinical staff in providing case management services to patients receiving surgical or medication abortion, as well as abortion related follow up connected to abortion care. Participates in routine outreach and collaboration with non-PPGOH abortion care providers to maintain up to date referral resources as well as work in partnership with the Development Team and Project Manager for Health Services regarding access funds for abortion services. Functions as part of the RQM Team and in collaboration with the Abortion Services Care Team. The ultimate goal of the patient navigator is to relieve as much of the logistical and practical burdens from the patient as possible, such that the path to obtaining high-quality, patient-centered abortion care is as clear and smooth as possible. This opportunity requires travel between Columbus and Bedford Heights Ohio.
