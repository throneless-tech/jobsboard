Provide is seeking a curious, communicative evaluation expert with excellent data analysis and visualization skills to lead the evaluation of our programs. The Director of Evaluation, in close collaboration with organizational and programmatic leadership and staff, will shape how Provide measures and communicates about the impact of its training interventions on healthcare and social service providers and the people in their communities who are seeking abortion and other stigmatized care.  This role is critical to maintaining the integrity of evaluation for our core abortion referrals training while ensuring that our methods and data collection are right-sized for our capacity and priorities.  The evaluator in this role will help us ask the right questions about our work by designing creative evaluation for new training and programming at the intersections of abortion access, stigma, and continuity of care.  They will lead the redesign of Provideâ€™s evaluation database, in collaboration with directors from our communications and programs department, to streamline and integrate the way we track and leverage data about program impact and relationship at Provide.  We are looking for a sharp, strategic thinker who easily connects the details of their evaluative work with our larger priorities and opportunities in the field and can clearly and expressively communicate relevant insights to internal stakeholders. Our ideal candidate is also committed to integrity in their work and applies values-based lenses to evaluation methods and plans to ensure our methods for measuring impact match said values.
