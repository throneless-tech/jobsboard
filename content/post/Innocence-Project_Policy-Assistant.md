The Innocence Project's Policy Department engages in policy advocacy through efforts in state legislatures, executive agencies and the courts to help reveal wrongful convictions, compensate the wrongfully convicted and prevent wrongful conviction by reforming the criminal legal system more broadly. Grounded in the principles of accuracy and reliability, equity and fairness, and transparency and accountability, the Innocence Project's Policy Team works with exonerated people and local innocence organizations to forge wrongful conviction reform throughout the nation.
The Policy Assistant is responsible for providing administrative support and logistical assistance to the entire state-based policy staff.  The Policy Assistant reports to the Director of Policy and assists all policy staff.
