Do you want to apply your fundraising talent to the growth of a nonprofit that is on the frontlines of supporting women’s health? Do you want to be challenged, collaborate with others on meaningful policy and consumer education, and make a significant impact on the field of women’s health? NWHN is in a transition period, and we need an experienced Development Director who can work with the rest of the team to shape and implement an ambitious fundraising strategy. This is a great opportunity for someone who wants not just a job but an opportunity to educate the American public about women’s health issues and hold federal agencies and institutions accountable to health topics that matter to women. We are centrally located in Washington D.C., our staff is super friendly, mission-driven, and we have a flexible work environment. We are looking for someone who will be a go-getter, self-starter, big-picture, strategist with an eye for detail and a willingness to support the entire fundraising process as well as working collaboratively with other teams. You will have the opportunity to play a key role in expanding the development function of the organization and you should have supervisory experience and extensive fundraising knowledge.
