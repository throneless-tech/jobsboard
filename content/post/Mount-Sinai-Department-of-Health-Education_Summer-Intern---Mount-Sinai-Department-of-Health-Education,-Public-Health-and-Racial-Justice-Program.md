The Mount Sinai Department of Health Education is proud to offer The Public Health and Racial Justice Program, an innovative education and empowerment program for youth of color between the ages of 16-18 years. Next summer, we will partner with the NYC Summer Youth Employment Program to offer this program onsite at the Mount Sinai Hospital (1468 Madison Ave.).  This innovative program exposes youth of color to the expansive field of public health through a racial justice lens, with an emphasis on equity, advocacy, and community engagement. Over the course of six weeks, participants will learn about a variety of public health topics and develop knowledge, skills, and confidence around critical analysis, civic engagement, creative expression, emotional processing, and reflection. Guest speakers from across the Mount Sinai Health System, city agencies, and community-based organizations will work with our young people, introducing them to various areas of study and work. Program participants will develop concrete tools and resources to promote public health awareness across their communities. Reporting to the Director of Health Education, and supporting our two full-time Health Educators who serve as the lead facilitators for this program, interns will support all onsite programming efforts, including but not limited to the following duties:
•	Assists in the development and presentation of health education sessions
•	Facilitates small breakout group discussions
•	Guides and supports the development of youth-led projects throughout programming
•	Chaperones onsite visits to various locations across the MSHS and field trips across NYC
•	Assists in the planning of an end-of-programming youth-led symposium 

We will prioritize candidates who have direct experience with group facilitation, working with young people, and working on issues of racial justice and/or health equity. 

It is important that all our program staff, including our interns, have deep connections and experience with the people and work our program supports. As such, we especially seek applications from individuals who identify as persons of color.
