In New York, ABB helped lead the effort to enact paid family leave in the state. We are now launching a campaign to build equivalent support and protections for those who need leave from work to manage their own medical needs and to update New York’s paid family leave program to better serve those who need support when they have a new child or need to care for a seriously ill family member. We are seeking an Organizer to help run that campaign.  The ideal candidate will be a team player who can communicate well with a wide range of individuals from a variety of social, ethnic, and organizational backgrounds and is very organized and detail oriented. The Organizer will be part of a team working to pass this important piece of legislation and will report to the Senior Staff Attorney spearheading this effort. This is a part-time position of 25-30 hours a week. We are open to a contract paid on an hourly basis. This position will be largely remote, but the candidate must live in New York State and must be willing to attend in-person events as needed; proximity to either Albany or New York City is preferred.
