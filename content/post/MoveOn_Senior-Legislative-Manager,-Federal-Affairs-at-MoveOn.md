MoveOn has a vital role to play in securing progress during the Biden-Harris administration, and in organizing the grassroots to set up election wins in 2021, 2022, and beyond. We are building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist movement, and fighting for progress on health care, climate, racial justice and more. In service of that mission, in 2021 and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact. This individual will join MoveOn’s Political & Federal Affairs. This operation drives MoveOn members’ work to elect progressives up and down the ticket and build power through elections. This team advocates on behalf of our members to Congress, the Administration, & our allies in DC; we are a strategic partner to our campaigning; and we are a key outside partner pushing inside-outside advocacy efforts for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.
