Are you looking for us?
As the Grantwriting Coordinator, you are excited by the prospect of interpreting complex concepts into compelling stories of impact and change. You have a keen eye for clear, scalable processes, and are as comfortable working independently as you are in a team. You have a strong appetite for data, deadlines, and documentation. You approach fundraising from a place of abundance, emergence, and as a political act. 

Position Description
The Grantwriting Coordinator is responsible for content generation for funding submissions, specifically in the area of foundation support, which comprises approximately three-quarters of the organizationâ€™s overall $22.8 million budget. The Grantwriting Coordinator actively contributes to the institutional giving team by developing timely, accurate and compelling written submissions for existing and prospective institutional funding sources, as aligned with the mission, vision, values, and strategies of NNAF.
