Support reproductive rights by joining the team at Boulder Abortion Clinic!

Seeking an abortion can be a stressful experience for many reasons- stigma, lack of resources, and a rapidly changing legal landscape. Our office is looking for an individual to help people break through these barriers to gain access to the care they need. As a patient care coordinator, you would be the initial point of contact for potential patients and their families, providing information by phone regarding scheduling, travel logistics and financial assistance. We strive to reassure every person by dispelling misleading information and providing
unparalleled emotional and logistical support with confidence, compassion and an understanding of the challenges our patients are facing.

Additional office responsibilities include explaining medical paperwork to patients, utilizing phone interpretation services to non-English speakers, setting up patients for exams, making calls or sending emails to partner organizations for fundraising or travel assistance, collecting payment for procedures, general filing and supplies ordering, and being willing to lend a hand to other staff members as needed. Fluency in a language other than English is highly desired since women travel to the clinic from around the world seeking late abortion care. This role requires flexibility and the ability to work as a team, managing challenging and unpredictable situations.

The position is for Monday-Friday, 8am-5pm, plus the possibility of a couple of weekend days per year. Depending upon patient needs, it is common to work later than 5pm on some evenings. Very flexible schedule for vacation time, personal appointments, etc. At this time all employees must wear face masks during their shifts. Salary is negotiable and commensurate with experience and includes the opportunity for competitive pay increases. Insurance, 401k, sick (+covid) and vacation pay are offered. Entry level starting pay is $25-30
per hour, plus benefits. To apply, please send a cover letter and resume by email to bac.conf@gmail.com.
