Thrive is seeking to hire a highly skilled, detail-oriented Project Manager to support the project through managing and coordinating all aspects of Thrive’s SPARK Innovation OKC project. SPARK Innovation OKC is a highly complex project focused on supporting community organizations to design innovative projects for caregivers (biological parents, guardians, adoptive parents, foster parents, grandparents, faith leaders, and staff of youth and family-serving organizations) with the goal of increasing communication about sexual health (including teen pregnancy and STI’s) between caregivers and the youth in their lives.
