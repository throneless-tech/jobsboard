The Community Managerâ€™s primary role is to build a sense of community and facilitate connections between future candidates, current candidates, and alumni (previously endorsed candidates). By organizing and facilitating virtual events and meetings, the Community Manager will create opportunities for dialogue, sharing of experiences, and learning within and across these constituencies. This work will have a particular focus on election administrator candidates in 2022, who will have dedicated, regular check-ins and one in-person convening, in order to provide them with enhanced training and support from peers, alumni, mentors, and partners. As a member of the Community Team, this position will also engage alumni in outreach and recruitment conversations with local potential candidates around election administration roles in their area, facilitate components of the Run for Something endorsement process, coordinate our alumni mentorship program, and manage our virtual alumni community to encourage dialogue and engagement.
