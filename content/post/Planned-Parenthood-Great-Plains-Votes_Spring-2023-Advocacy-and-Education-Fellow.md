The Spring 2023 Advocacy and Education Fellowship is a training program for activists in Kansas to take on leadership and learn the skills of community organizing, including: how to build a base, cultivate relationships, communicate effectively with volunteers, and educate and mobilize voters. Fellows will gain the tools they need to be educators and advocates in their local communities around sexual and reproductive health, rights, and justice. This fellowship will give an opportunity to selected leaders to play an integral role in engaging constituents around the legislative process and community members around reproductive health equity. This is a hybrid fellowship that requires internet access. 
It is a 15 week program running from the 3rd week of January through the 1st week of May with the exception of March 13-19 for Spring Break. Excluding March 13-19, this program has an expected commitment of 10 hours per week
