NextGen America is seeking passionate and hardworking candidates to join our youth organizing program in Arizona, working to engage young people in electoral politics by registering thousands of young people to vote across the state. NextGen is committed to engaging young people in Arizona in the political process and increasing participation among 18-35 year olds. This role will be focused on organizing in one of several regions in Arizona as part of this ambitious effort. 

In Arizona, this effort will focus on organizing young people on campuses and the surrounding communities to bring progressive change to government through voting. Our work will engage young people in voter registration efforts, volunteer recruitment, and pledging young people to vote. Organizers need to be comfortable and confident in: mobilizing their own community, growing their network to include new volunteers to train, and motivating community leaders to help register and mobilize their own networks. Organizers are directly responsible for managing a team of volunteers in their region to hit weekly and phase metric goals. 

This role will be based in Phoenix and reports to the Organizing Director in Arizona.
