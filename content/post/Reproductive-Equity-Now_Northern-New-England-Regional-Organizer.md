Reproductive Equity Now (REN) seeks a full-time (40 hours per week) New Hampshire-based Northern New England Regional Organizer to spearhead voter education and engagement in northern New England. This is a critical moment to double down on the role of states in protecting abortion access. New Hampshire will play a key role both throughout New England and on the
national stage on the future of abortion access. REN is excited to invest in northern New England.
The goal of RENâ€™s work will be to educate and engage the public on the importance of electing politicians at all levels of government who support reproductive freedom. This position is ideal for someone passionate about reproductive equity who believes deeply in the importance of building
leadership, capacity, and power by engaging directly with voters and volunteers while working collaboratively with organizations currently working in northern New England. The Northern New England Political Organizer will report to the Political and Field Director and work in close collaboration with a growing programmatic team at REN.
