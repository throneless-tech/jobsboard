Groundswell Fund is seeking a full-time trainer for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the curriculum for our Capacity Building programs, which include the Grassroots Organizing Institute (GOI) and the Integrated Voter Engagement (IVE) Program. The ideal candidate will have a proven ability to train on curriculum and workshops for grassroots power building organizations, identifying appropriate training for grantee organizations through data- and evidence-based methods, and monitoring the effectiveness of those trainings and curriculum. The ideal candidate will be committed to getting results in a fast-paced environment and able to handle periods with heavy workloads during program implementation. This position requires travel; however, in 2021, we have opted to suspend all travel until COVID is under control.
