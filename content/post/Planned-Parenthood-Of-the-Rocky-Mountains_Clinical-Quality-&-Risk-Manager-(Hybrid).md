In this role you can expect to spend ~70% of your time working remotely. Remote work will focus on continuously working on ideas to improve and expand clinical services, launching new initiatives, supporting change management, and other special projects. About a quarter of this work will be to obtain and analyze clinical data from audits, chart reviews, incident reports etc. to monitor the quality of care, identify exposures to risk, and develop/implement professional development opportunities for clinicians.
 
You can expect to carry out some of this work in person as well. ~30% of this role will require travel (~5-7 days a month) to your assigned health centers in our region (CO, NM, and Las Vegas, NV). The bulk of this time will be interacting with patients, clinicians, and other staff. Non-local travel can be for a few days at a time. On-site work is key to this role so you can implement and observe clinical guidelines in action, identify necessary changes, and establish risk mitigation processes at our health center
