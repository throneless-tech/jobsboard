The Health Care Scholar will have the opportunity to work with TCFâ€™s Health Care Equity and Reform team to advance policies that improve health care access, equity, and quality. This could include research relating to the Black maternal health crisis, reproductive health access, addressing disparities in health coverage, making prescription drugs more affordable, and more. A typical day might involve working on conducting research on abortion laws in a particular state, writing a policy memo on legislative efforts to lower health care costs, building a chart to more clearly depict racial disparities relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, or connecting with our networks to engage on these important issues. The Health Care Scholar will contribute to research and team projects and have the opportunity to author content for the TCF website.
