The primary role of the Senior Program Officer (SPO) is to contribute to investment strategies that align with both the Foundation’s goals as well as the Global Program team’s strategy, and to manage a portfolio of grants. The SPO will report to the Director of Global Programs and play a critical role in modeling the mind-sets and behaviors of a highly nimble, collaborative and inclusive team culture, helping to lead implementation of GP’s ambitious strategy. They will demonstrate adaptability with regard to managing and addressing the needs of different stakeholders, both internal and external. The SPO will see themselves as a leader who embraces the opportunity to positively contribute to the team — through curiosity, humility, empathy, and humor — our strategy, and our partners in all facets of work.
