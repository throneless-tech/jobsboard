We Testify is hiring a Communications & Development Coordinator to support the voices of abortion storytellers in media and the movement, elevate the organization’s vision of culture shift through innovative campaigns and social media, and maintain the organization’s brand identity. The Communications & Development Coordinator role includes supporting people who’ve had abortions to connect deeper to their experiences while deciding which parts of their stories they’d like to share with the world. You’ll pitch reporters to encourage them to elevate abortion storytellers, and ensure that media coverage of abortion storytellers is accurate and reflective of our actual experiences. The Communications & Development Coordinator will support visionary campaigns that reflect our abortion experiences, engage with our donors and supporters, and challenge the people who love us to think deeper about our full spectrum of experiences.
