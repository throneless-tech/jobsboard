Reporting to the Chief Federal Legislative Counsel, the WHPA Campaign Manager will help manage a growing national campaign that unites organizations and individuals in support of the Women’s Health Protection Act—federal legislation designed to enforce and protect the right of every person to decide for themselves whether to continue or end a pregnancy, regardless of where they live. The Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) was first introduced in 2013 and has been reintroduced in each subsequent Congress in both the House and Senate, with broad support. Along with the EACH Act, WHPA is the signature abortion access bill in Congress. The Campaign built in support of this bill now has over 100 member organizations and individuals. This past year, the momentum supporting WHPA has steadily increased, as we have seen calls on Congress to respond to the SCOTUS decision overturning Roe.
