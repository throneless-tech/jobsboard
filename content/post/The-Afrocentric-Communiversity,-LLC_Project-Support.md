We are looking for people with an unwavering commitment to radical, Black, Afrofuturist diasporic mental, physical and spiritual liberation. More specifically, we aim to build civically engaged & culturally conscious community institutions in the Black community. We are excited about the prospect of working with organizations to help them transform and grow, who feel passionately about building leader-full move+meants, and who feel energized and confident about facilitating meetings, workshops and engagement sessions. We want people who have a solid foundational understanding of the nonprofit industrial complex and nonprofit consulting industries.
