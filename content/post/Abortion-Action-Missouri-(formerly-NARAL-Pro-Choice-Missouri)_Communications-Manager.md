Enthusiastic, creative go-getter with communications, public relations, and digital experience, who is excited to work hard to advance reproductive freedom and stigma-free abortion access for all. Work with the policy manager and executive director to implement an aggressive media outreach and digital communications strategy for Abortion Action Missouri. Responsible for drafting quotes, talking points, and press releases, as well as managing organizational content calendar that includes social media, membership emails, and other digital tools to create a robust digital footprint that draws in membership and traffic. Overall, the communications manager role is equal parts public liaison and content creation. Someone in this position might just as easily hold a press conference to announce a new initiative or respond to media inquiries as they would pore over the details of a spreadsheet to ensure the PR budget is on track, or draft an educational tweet thread. Must be passionate about reproductive health, rights, and justice, like to talk (especially to reporters), and interested in identifying new opportunities for the organization to explore.
