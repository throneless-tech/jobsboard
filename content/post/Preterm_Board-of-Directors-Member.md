Our board is a hybrid working + governance board that works in lock-step with our Executive Director, as well as other Directors of Preterm, and the Preterm Union. We lead by centering our patients, frontline staff, and community in all of our decision-making.  Board member roles require a 3-8 hour per month commitment that encompasses one monthly board meeting on the third Tuesday of each month as well as enrollment in at least one committee of the board, which meets for one hour at least once per month.
