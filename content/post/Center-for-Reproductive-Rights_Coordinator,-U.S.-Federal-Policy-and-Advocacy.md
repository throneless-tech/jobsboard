The individual in this role will report directly to the Director of the Federal Policy and Advocacy Team and will assist in collaborative projects that involve liaising with the other GER Departments, US Program Management, and the Center’s Communications, and Development teams, among others.  Projects may include updating policy documents, fact sheets, and digital tools; supporting cross-department research needs; coordinating congressional briefings and supporting hearing preparation; updating and finalizing communications to Members of U.S. Congress and their staff; providing internal and external updates on bill introductions and movement. This position will also provide support to the team’s advocacy before the Executive Branch, with similar tasks as those described for congressional work, as needed.
