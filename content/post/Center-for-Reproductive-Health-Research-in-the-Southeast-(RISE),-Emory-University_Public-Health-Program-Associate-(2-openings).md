RISE (https://rise.emory.edu/) is hiring two Public Health Program Associates to manage and coordinate research projects and Center operations. These positions are hybrid, with in-person responsibilities a few days per week and the ability to work from home a few days per week. One new RISE staff member will support research projects that evaluate state-specific policy and programmatic opportunities to expand access to contraception and abortion care, and that estimate patterns in contraceptive and abortion care and related health experiences surrounding shifts in state policy. The other new RISE staff member will support research projects related to family planning and abortion access and service delivery, including telehealth for family planning and medication abortion, and task-shifting and service delivery of reproductive health services. Additionally, this position will involve abortion education research and program development.
