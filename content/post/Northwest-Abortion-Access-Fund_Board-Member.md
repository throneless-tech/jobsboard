The NWAAF Board of Directors is vital to the function of our organization. We create and manage the budget, execute all fundraisers and events (both in person and digital), manage social media, work closely with the staff and programs team to support callers in the ways they need, serve on our hotline, and fiercely advocate for abortion access in our region. All while working to make NWAAF, and the abortion landscape as a whole, more equitable. The board functions as a working board using a flat, non-hierarchical structure, and all of our work is done remotely. We welcome applicants from Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon, to apply!
