We are seeking an inaugural Executive Director (ED) to lead the work of SAL. As a new organization, the ED will have to set up all of the initial functions – although this will be done in conjunction with the Fiscal Sponsorship team at NEO Philanthropy, where SAL is housed. We are seeking a candidate that understands and has experience in the abortion access and reproductive rights work in the US and specifically, in coalition building and collaborative support. The ED will be a person who is comfortable being in the “background” in movement spaces, while supporting the needs of state-based coalitions to be in the foreground of the work on abortion access and reproductive rights. The ED will have experience managing and developing systems and teams – experience having run an organization previously is a plus.
