Position Overview
The Director of Government Relations will lead NARAL’s government relations operation, including federal lobbyists and internal federal and state policy teams, in building and leveraging strategic relationships and integrating its work with the campaign, political and communications teams.  

The Director will develop and implement new strategies to use governmental levers to change the national debate on reproductive rights; use policy advocacy to build power; work toward better policy outcomes at the state and federal levels; work with coalition partners and allies for greater impact; and defend against anti-choice legislation and regulations.   

The Director will possess political sensibility as well as alignment with NARAL’s values and proven leadership experience overseeing a team to achieve legislative, regulatory, and policy change.

As a senior leader, the Director will work collaboratively with other department directors and NARAL executive leaders to achieve our mission.
