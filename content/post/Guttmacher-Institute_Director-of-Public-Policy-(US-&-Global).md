The Director of Public Policy is a senior position responsible for managing all aspects of the Institute’s work to advance a federal and global policy agenda for SRHR that is comprehensive, evidence-based and rooted in human rights principles. Reporting to the Vice President for Public Policy, the Director works with a broad range of stakeholders to bring the Institute’s data, analysis and strategic expertise to bear on federal and global policy discussions. An expectation of this position is to take an active role in advancing an organizational culture that centers equity and justice, collaboration, integrity, nimbleness and a global perspective, seeing connections across SRHR issues and different contexts throughout the world. The Director must be committed to supporting an equitable and inclusive work environment and managing relations with a diverse staff, including staff under their own supervision.
