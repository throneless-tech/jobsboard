WHO/O is seeking a contractor for a Social Media & Communications Coordinator in expectation of the drastic increase in need for and interest in WHO/O’s work following a SCOTUS decision on the right to abortion. The last couple of years have been ones of incredible growth and we need someone who has the skill to help create media and content for an organization with a sharp focus on racial, economic, and gender justice, and one that seeks to reach folks across Ohio for a variety of means of engagement or assistance. The Social Media & Communications Coordinator will work with the Interim Executive Director and Board Chair to create and execute online strategies that grow followers and increase WHO/O’s exposure as the only statewide Abortion Fund and the leading edge of Pro-Abortion advocacy in Ohio. This person will create engaging contact across platforms to inform and engage intersectional communities about our services and values. Crafting strategic and engaging calls to action or infographics across social media platforms and digital applications are a key part of this role!
