About the People & Culture Director

The People & Culture Director supports the organizational development of the staff, Board of Directors, and Membership by providing direction of administration and  systems development to support values-aligned policies and practices. This position will be key to the transformation of the culture at BYP100 ensuring our human resources processes are grounded in our values and are in collaboration with our union; BYP100 Worker’s United. Some of these policies and practices include on-boarding of new staff; staff evaluations and celebrations and our Healing and Safety work. 

Our People & Culture Director will use BYP100’s values as guides for how we work, communicate, grow, and practice the culture to build a movement of young, Black organizers. They carry a vision with flexibility and attention to the organization’s capacities, resources, and will be skillful at helping shift priorities to meet goals and prevent a culture of burnout. They would be a dynamic and thoughtful facilitator, cultivating everyday practices of our values.
