The Public Policy and Organizing Manager (PPOM) will assist the Georgia State Director in the work of increasing public and legislative support for Planned Parenthood Southeastâ€™s mission. The PPOM's duties include protecting access to reproductive health care through assisting with development and implementation of legislative campaigns. The PPOM will engage supporters and volunteers through meaningful training and engagement opportunities, including campaigns built to reduce stigma, and build power to leverage on behalf of the communities we serve by increasing our supporter base and capacity. In addition, the PPOM works with the Georgia State Director and other staff and volunteers to further the educational, political, and electoral goals of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates including electing legislators who support access to a full range of reproductive health care. The PPOM will directly manage and support the Georgia Field Organizers.
