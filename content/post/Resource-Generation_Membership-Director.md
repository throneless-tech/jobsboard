The Membership Director is equivalent to a Development Director position at many other organizations, and will bear primary responsibility for raising our annual budget (~$4M in 2022). They will collaborate closely with our Organizing team, Operations team, and Communications, Database, & Digital Engagement team, and will supervise our Membership Coordinator. This position will be responsible for setting our integrated fundraising strategy and managing our full team to implement it, including around major donor work, grassroots membership, and two annual membership and redistribution pledge drives.
