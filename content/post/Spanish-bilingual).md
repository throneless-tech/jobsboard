Reporting to the Director of Strategy & Communications, the Communications Manager will manage the organization's key contacts and relationships with media consultants and individual journalists throughout the Americas. This is a great opportunity for someone who is proactive, creative and has a deep understanding of how to use press to shape narratives and help sway public opinion. The Communications Manager will need to be bilingual, and fluently speak, write, and read in Spanish and English.
