The Legal & Grants Associate will provide administrative and legal support to the Legal & Strategic Initiatives Department and facilitate the coordination of all outgoing grants made to our 30+ Conservation Voter Movement (CVM) state league and other partners. The Legal & Grants Associate plays a critical role in supporting the Legal & Strategic Initiatives department and works cross-departmentally on our highly collaborative grants, contracts, and compliance programs. The ideal candidate has incredibly strong attention to detail, the ability to manage time well and balance multiple tasks, and works well independently and as part of a team.
