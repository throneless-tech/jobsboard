The DuPont Clinic is a referral center for all-trimester abortion care and ultrasound-guided procedures, primarily for management of abnormal and high-risk pregnancies. We provide the highest level of medical care and an experience focused on the needs of each patient. The DuPont Clinic provides care to people with complex medical situations who would otherwise have difficulty obtaining care. We are seeking staff who come from many backgrounds and experiences and are particularly committed to hiring staff who are native speakers of languages other than English, particularly Spanish. We seek to hire a registered nurse (RN) who will be an integral part of the team creating the patient experience and ensuring patient safety. This position is part-time or full-time with a flexible schedule of 2-4 days per week, with limited call from home. No nights or weekends. The right person for this position will have the highest standards for patient safety, be motivated to create a positive patient experience, strongly support bodily autonomy, and, ideally, speak a second language. This position will have the opportunities for learning, including ultrasound, abortion care, and gynecologic care.
