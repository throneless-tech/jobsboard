Summary: NARAL Pro‐Choice Maryland seeks a dynamic and skilled Executive Director to lead the organization in fulfilling its mission to develop and sustain a constituency that uses the political process to guarantee every person has the right to make personal decisions regarding the full range of reproductive health choices, including, yet not limited to, preventing unintended pregnancy, bearing healthy children, and choosing legal abortion. NARAL Pro‐Choice Maryland is a grass‐roots 501(c)(4) lobbying organization. Two additional affiliated organizations help advance the            NARAL Pro‐Choice Maryland mission. The NARAL Pro‐Choice Maryland Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, provides education, research, and community organizing to increase public awareness and statewide activism relevant to reproductive health care issues. The NARAL Pro‐Choice MD PAC, a state political action committee, conducts direct electoral work with and for candidates that support reproductive health care, including abortion rights.

The Executive Director is responsible for programmatic, financial and administrative management of NARAL Pro‐Choice Maryland and its affiliated entities. In addition to overall responsibility for day-to-day operations and programs, the Executive Director is responsible for the financial security of the organization through effective fundraising for all three entities. The Executive Director is the primary spokesperson and public face of NARAL Pro‐Choice Maryland.  As such, the Executive Director is expected to play a strong, visible, and strategic role in developing and implementing plans to promote abortion rights legislation and policies, and to elect candidates that support abortion rights, across the state.
