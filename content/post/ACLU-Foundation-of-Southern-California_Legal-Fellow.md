ACLU SoCal seeks applicants with 0-2 years of legal experience to pursue fellowships, in specific subject areas including working with the LGBTQ, Gender & Reproductive Justice Team to challenge the surveillance and punishment of parents and children by the family policing (aka "child welfare") system in Southern California. Once ACLU SoCal selects candidate(s), we will work with them to craft a fellowship proposal and submit a joint application to the sponsoring school or organization. Fellows will serve either a 1- or 2-year term. This is an NOLSW bargaining unit position. Applicants pursuing Skadden/EJW/Soros/Justice Catalyst fellowships must apply on or before 7/2/2023; applicants interested in school-based or other fellowships may apply on a rolling basis. Applications must include a detailed cover letter, resume, 3 references, a writing sample, and a law school transcript.
