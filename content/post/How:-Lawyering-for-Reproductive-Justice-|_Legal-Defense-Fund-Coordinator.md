We seek a Legal Defense Fund Coordinator who will provide administrative support and program coordination to the soon-to-be-launched Repro Legal Defense Fund (LDF), a fund that defrays legal costs for people who are criminalized for allegedly ending their own pregnancies or helping another person do so. This position requires someone who is adept at handling client intake and financial transactions, ideally with experience working within a legal setting. The right person for the job is organized, meticulous about details, and comfortable with communicating in a friendly, professional manner with potential clients, attorneys, consultants, and external stakeholders.
