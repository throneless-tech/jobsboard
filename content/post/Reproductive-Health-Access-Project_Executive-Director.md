With a passionate professional staff, dynamic and multidisciplinary board, a $1.3M+ budget, and a national network of primary care clinicians exceeding 6,000 members, a reproductive health fellowship program with
extensive education and more, RHAP now seeks a new Executive Director who will chart the next phase of RHAP’s future to center equity and justice as priorities within all aspects of its strategy, programs, and
operations. The work ahead calls for a leader with a broad vision for increasing access to sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion, who takes into account the evolving, highly restricted abortion
access landscape. This next stage also requires RHAP to ensure that the most important voices are at the table, including centering the experiences of BIPOC communities, communities at the margins, and wider
ranging geographic perspectives.
