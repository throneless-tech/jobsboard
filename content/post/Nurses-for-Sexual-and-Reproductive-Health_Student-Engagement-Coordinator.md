The person who fills this position will play a vital role in coordinating, recruiting for, and supporting our Chapter Organizing Program. NSRH began from nursing student activism and our Chapter Organizing Program remains the cornerstone of the organization. Our Nursing School Chapters form a nationwide community of nursing students and educators at nursing schools throughout the country that organize and advocate for the inclusion of sexual and reproductive health, rights, and justice within nursing education. With financial and coaching support and resources from NSRH, our Chapters are organizing for curriculum reform and coordinating sexual and reproductive health, rights, and justice events on their campuses.
