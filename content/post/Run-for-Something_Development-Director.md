The Development Director’s primary role is to strategize and execute Run for Something’s fundraising plan, which includes Run for Something PAC (a non-federal 527 PAC with several state PACs through RFS Ascend), Run for Something Action Fund (a 501c4), and a potential 501c3. This fundraising strategy will include the expansion of outreach and engagement of our grassroots operation (online), major/high net worth donors, partnerships/sponsorships, and grants. In addition, this position contributes to fundraising management and events-based fundraising through the supervision of 2 staff members. 

As a member of the RFS Leadership Team, this position must also contribute, integrate, and hold themselves and their department accountable to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) goals that Run for Something has established, and actively contribute towards the creation of a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture.
