The Data and Analytics Director plays an integral role in informing NextGen Americaâ€™s program strategy and optimizing voter outreach using data and analytics methods. The Data and Analytics Director will be responsible for managing our data staff, contributing to targeting and universe creation for voter contact, and providing verbal and written data analysis and reporting internally (to leadership and staff) and externally (to partners, donors, and other stakeholders). The Data and Analytics Director must be a strategic leader and thinker, utilizing data to position NextGen as the preeminent leader in the youth vote space.
