Every Mother Counts is seeking to add a Manager, Communications and Marketing to its rapidly growing Communications and Marketing team. The Communications Team leverages the power of strong communications tools and compelling storytelling to advance EMC’s mission and motivate the public to take action for maternal health through donations and advocacy for key maternal health policies. The ideal candidate for Manager, Communications
and Marketing will be a communications generalist with experience across the full range of communications activities, from writing and editing, to campaign development and execution, to media relations. The Manager must have a passion for using communications tactics to further institutional objectives and reach key stakeholders. The ideal candidate will be both a big picture strategic and creative thinker and a doer who is willing to take on tasks, large and small, to achieve shared goals. The Manager will work collaboratively with all members of the Communications team and with others across EMC. They will have a deep understanding of EMC’s mission, and will be excited by the opportunity to create a best-in-class communications function to support
the organization’s work.
