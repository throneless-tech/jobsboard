The DC Community Organizer will work on a team of organizers to build people power and make concrete change at the local level in Washington, DC. This is a full-time position based out of JUFJ’s DC office, which is eligible to join our staff union (NPEU/Local 70, IFPTE). All staff can work remotely unless attending an event or action. JUFJ advances economic, racial, and social justice in DC and Maryland by educating and mobilizing local Jewish communities to action (you do not need to be Jewish to work at JUFJ).
