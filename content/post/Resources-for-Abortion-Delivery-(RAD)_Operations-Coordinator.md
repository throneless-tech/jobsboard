The Operations Coordinator (OC) supports our organizationâ€™s excellence by performing significant administrative and coordinating duties as part of a small and dynamic operations team. The Operations Coordinator is responsible for independently managing a range of every day administrative duties that include: tracking and processing payments to vendors and staff reimbursements, coordinating conference exhibiting and sponsorship; and supporting both external communications and internal information-sharing. The Operations Coordinator will carry out these duties in alignment with established protocols and processes, coordinating with other staff as needed.
