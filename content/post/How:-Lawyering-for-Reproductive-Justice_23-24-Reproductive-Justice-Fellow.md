The Reproductive Justice Fellowship Program (RJFP) is a policy-focused fellowship designed to create entry points into the reproductive health, rights, and justice fields and to enhance legal and advocacy capacity at organizations working to advance reproductive justice for all people. Reproductive Justice (RJ) Fellows gain hands-on policy advocacy experience and work on cutting edge reproductive health, rights, justice issues, learning from advocates working at the federal, state, and local level. Through a matching process, RJ Fellows are placed at organizations across the country to work as full-time staff during the year-long program, which includes mentoring, professional development, skills-based training, and networking opportunities. Fellows also receive health insurance, PTO, and other benefits from their placement organizations. Remote and in-person positions are available.
