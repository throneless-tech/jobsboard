To be successful in this position, the Associate Editor will be as comfortable copyediting a reported article as they are a tweet thread, a newsletter, and a grant report (and possibly all on the same day). The Associate Editor will be a multitasker who can work quickly and accurately under pressure as the last set of eyes on our work. While this is an editing position, the opportunity to help create content is possible for the right candidate whoâ€™s interested. This position will report to the Senior Editor, work cross-functionally with departments, and work especially closely with the editorial team on a daily basis.
