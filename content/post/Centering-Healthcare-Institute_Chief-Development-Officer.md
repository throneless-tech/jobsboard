Centering Healthcare Institute (CHI) has experienced significant growth over recent years and is eager to embark on our ambitious plan to bring the Centering model to more healthcare providers nationwide. CHI is seeking a dynamic, highly motivated senior fundraising professional who can bring the organization forward into a new, exciting phase of institutional and fundraising growth. We seek to fill the newly created Chief Development Officer (CDO) position. 
Reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, the CDO will be responsible for the comprehensive planning, implementation, and management of strategies to secure donors and contributions supporting the organization while expanding our work with individual, corporate, and foundation partners.  
The Chief Development Officer will build out and manage a team of fundraising professionals ready to take CHIâ€™s fundraising initiatives to the next level.
