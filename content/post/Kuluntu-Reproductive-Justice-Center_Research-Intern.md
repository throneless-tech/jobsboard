We are seeking a justice-minded and self-directed research intern to support our organization's efforts in creating a world in which birth justice is achieved. The intern will focus on conducting a comprehensive literature review on (Black) alternative family structures, exploring the experiences and challenges faced by individuals in non-traditional family arrangements, including but not limited to LGBTQI couples, single parents, polyamorous families, blended families, and other types of chosen families. In this position, the Research Intern can be expected to gain experience and knowledge in reproductive justice, birth justice, and public health research. This research will contribute to our overall understanding of the complexities of non-normative family structures and the impact they have on reproductive healthcare, rights, and justice.
