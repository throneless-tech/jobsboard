Planned Parenthood Empire State Acts (PPESA) is a statewide electoral and legislative advocacy organization, and political action committee (PAC). PPESA is New York’s health care partner in ensuring statewide access to family planning services and reproductive health care, as well as being part of the larger Planned Parenthood network, including other states and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. PPESA supports New York’s Planned Parenthood Affiliates by advocating for public health policies that promote a sound health care system and fights efforts to curtail access to care.  PPESA’s mission is to help build a world in which every person — regardless of their race, income, insurance, gender identity, sexual orientation, abilities, or immigration status — can access expert, compassionate sexual and reproductive health care, information, and education without shame or judgement. The next CEO of PPESA will be someone authentically aligned and has a deep personal commitment to the mission and strategy of the organization. The CEO will take a holistic view on reproductive health and access. They will be a natural problem solver and thrive in fostering clarity and alignment in complexity by identifying strategic solutions that deliver results and align with PPESA’s values. Reporting into the PPESA Board of Directors, the CEO will be politically savvy with an understanding of policy and advocacy to set and protect the Affiliates’ legislative agendas.  With a keen sense of sensitivity and diplomacy, the next leader of PPESA will be able to navigate in a nuanced and complex environment on a number of different agenda items to advance reproductive health and access in New York state.  As a spokesperson, they will represent PPESA through media appearances, speaking engagements, and partnerships with aligned organizations and coalitions.
