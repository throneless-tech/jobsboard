Gain valuable political experience and help elect Democratic pro-choice women up and down the ticket! We offer internships spring, summer, and fall in all of our departments. Interns have the opportunity to do substantive work, while gaining in-depth experience in the political sector. In addition to daily work in their departments and attendance at staff events, interns participate in lunch and learn sessions, which gives them the opportunity to hear from varying levels of staff while learning about their professional history and gaining deeper knowledge about how all the departments at EMILYs List work. Interns will have the opportunity to participate in custom trainings guiding interns through the life cycle of a campaign; every intern leaves EMILYs List ready for life on the campaign trail. By the end of the semester interns will have the skills for beginning a career in campaigns. Interns are paid at a rate of $17 per hour. Interns have the flexibility to opt for a fully remote or hybrid internship experience. Hybrid interns will mutually agree on a weekly schedule for coming into the office with their respective supervisor.
