Over the next 12 months, the National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF) seeks to redesign and rebuild an existing Wordpress site. We’re looking for a partner in this work able to:
--> Lead discovery for our website redesign project, conducting stakeholder interviews with NNAF staff, a representative sample of abortion fund members, and users of the site. 
--> Provide recommendations for content strategy as well as plug-ins and integrations to improve site functionality, keeping in mind our need for a site that is both accessible and highly secure.
--> Run a design and build process that allows every member of the NNAF staff to offer input at least once. 
--> Provide a framework for the content migration process that is clear and easy to use.  
--> Limit the impact of the site redesign on our SEO performance – offer suggestions for how to maintain and improve SEO in the future.
--> Train NNAF staff on maintaining the website.
