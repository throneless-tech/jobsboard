You may work from home or the office, answering a high volume of calls as they come in throughout the day. During each call you will make a patient appointment or address any concerns and questions as they arise, connecting the patient with the appropriate team member when necessary. If you work from home, you will need a reliable internet connection, and quiet space that is free of distractions, so that you can focus on your job responsibilities. Background noise should be limited, and you must be able to maintain a space that provides patient confidentiality. You may be required to be in the office occasionally for administrative duties, training, or team building.
