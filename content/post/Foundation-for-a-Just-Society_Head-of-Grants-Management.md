The head of grants management (“HGM”) will report to the chief financial officer and will be structurally integrated within the program team. This deliberate cross-functional structure is designed to allow the HGM to have a general understanding of the programmatic direction, be aware of priorities, be alerted to developing plans that might be complex from a grants management perspective, and build relationships with Foundation staff and grantee partners, all while implementing best practices in grants management and compliance.
