Founded in 2016, Path Forward is on a mission to empower stay-at-home mothers and other caregivers to restart their careers. We fulfill our mission by working with employers to launch, implement and expand returnships -- a specific workforce development program geared toward professionals with post-college work experience and a significant gap in their career due to unpaid caregiving.  Path Forward is looking for an experienced, strategic, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and motivated professional to join our staff as Program Director. The Program Director will play a key role in the continued growth and expansion of Path Forward by managing all aspects of our current program and leading in the creation and development of new programs. The ideal candidate will be able to create and oversee management of multi year initiatives, while successfully managing day-to-day tasks related to running our current programs and managing existing partner relationships.
