The Eastern MA Abortion (EMA) Fund seeks two part-time Hotline Coordinators to assist in managing our hotline. EMA's hotline is how callers request funding for abortion appointments (or related expenses). Coordinators will speak directly with hotline callers or assist volunteers taking calls, depending on the week, and will work closely with local clinics. This role is fully remote with flexible hours, though preference is for those able to travel 1-2 times a month to Cambridge, MA (where our mailbox is located).  Hours are up to 20 hours/week, split between two Coordinators with a flexible schedule. Currently, Coordinators report to the Board of Directors.
