We seek an exceptional scholar with a strong background and interest in reproductive health research, including health policy, abortion, and contraception, for a senior research associate position at the University of Cincinnati. The senior research associate will work closely with Danielle Bessett (Sociology) on studies focused on abortion policies and their effects on abortion-seeking experiences and health system impacts in Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky. We expect data collection to be challenging and data analysis to be complex. The senior research associate will manage qualitative and quantitative studies and be involved in analysis and interpretation of findings, with an emphasis on disseminating results with principal investigators and co-investigators. The candidate must have prior experience analyzing quantitative data.
