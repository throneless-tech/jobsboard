Your days will be a mix of in person and remote work. You will spend your time coalition-building, having one on one meetings with potential volunteer activists, supporting the campaign organizers on your team, planning virtual and in person educational and engagement events, tracking your efforts in our database, and supporting our coalition partners in their community efforts. You will travel within your state and within our four- state affiliate region occasionally. You will manage your work hours to include some evenings and weekends.
