Women Enabled International (WEI) is now accepting applications for the position of Executive Director. Building on the founding Executive Directorâ€™s leadership, this is an exciting opportunity to deepen the impact and reach of a unique global organization that advances the rights of women and girls with disabilities.
The Executive Director will lead strategic development and program priorities to influence global, regional and national levels, catalyze partnerships within the disability and feminist movements and manage a current staff of nine and organizational budget of about $1.5 million. The world we want requires not only a commitment to our mission, but also the bravery to uproot oppressive power structures and fuel disabled feminist leadership inside and outside WEI.
