Ibis Reproductive Health is seeking two research managers who will support a range of research projects primarily related to 1) self-managed abortion and abortion supported by feminist accompaniment partners in Latin America and the Africa region, and 2) the expansion of medication abortion access in the US with a focus on the use of a misoprostol only regimen. Research Managers may also support other research projects aligned with Ibisâ€™s mission, including but not limited to research projects related to the sexual and reproductive health needs and experiences of transgender and nonbinary people in the US. Areas of responsibility include: management and oversight of research projects; quantitative and qualitative data collection; descriptive and multivariable quantitative data analysis; qualitative analysis; management and growth of project partnerships; development of evidence-based, actionable materials for dissemination to a variety of audiences; and supporting development of grant proposals and administrative tasks.
