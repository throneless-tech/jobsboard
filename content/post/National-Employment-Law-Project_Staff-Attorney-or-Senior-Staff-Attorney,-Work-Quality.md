You may be based in any of NELP’s three office locations and will report to the Director of Work Quality. You will work in conjunction with NELP’s staff of lawyers, policy experts, researchers, and strategic communications experts. You will work with grassroots organizing groups and reformers to design, promote and ensure the successful implementation of laws that will respond to eroding labor standards, rising income and wealth inequality, persistent structural racism and occupational segregation, and the shifting of power away from workers and toward corporations.
