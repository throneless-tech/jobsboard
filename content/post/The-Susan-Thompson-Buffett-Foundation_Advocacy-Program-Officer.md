The primary role of the Program Officer (PO) is to work closely with the Senior Program Officer (SPO) for Global Advocacy on the ongoing refinement and implementation of the global advocacy strategy and manages grants within the portfolio. The PO will report to the SPO for Global Advocacy and play a critical role in modeling the mind-sets and behaviors of a collaborative and inclusive team culture, helping to lead implementation of GP’s ambitious strategy. They will demonstrate adaptability with regard to managing and addressing the needs of different stakeholders, both internal and external. The PO will see themselves as a leader who embraces the opportunity to positively influence — through curiosity, empathy, humor and assistance — their colleagues in the development and vetting of proposals and the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs.
