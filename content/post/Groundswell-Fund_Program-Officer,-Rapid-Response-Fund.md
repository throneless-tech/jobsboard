The Program Officer is responsible for managing Groundswellâ€™s Rapid
Response Fund and supporting other grantmaking as needed. A significant part of the role will
involve managing the day-to-day needs of the Rapid Response Fund that makes grants on a
monthly basis. Role will also include conducting ongoing outreach, relationship building, and
strategic communications to ensure resources are reaching historically under-resourced
communities and geographies. The Program Officer will work closely with the Senior Director of
Grantmaking, fellow Program Officers and Program Associates and the Capacity Building Team
to move resources to the field and support grantees in a timely manner. All Groundswell Fund
Program Officers play an important role in the field of philanthropy by generating increased
visibility and resources for reproductive and social justice movements.
