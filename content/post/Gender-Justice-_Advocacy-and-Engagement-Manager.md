The Advocacy and Engagement Manager will work hand-in-hand with the Advocacy Director to manage advocacy,
education, and public engagement projects across projects, coalitions, and partnerships. Specifically, the Advocacy and
Engagement Manager will coordinate a coalition of groups (Gender Justice, Take Action MN, OutFront MN, and Jewish
Community Action) and develop collaborative strategies to counter efforts to use religion as a license to discriminate.
They will also take the lead on advocacy and education work supporting the rights of transgender athletes to compete
in alignment with our legal case on behalf of powerlifter JayCee Cooper. A large part of this role will be working on
managing, building, and deepening the organizationâ€™s coalition work and increasing our effectiveness at demonstrating
public support for our initiatives
