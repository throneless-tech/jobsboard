Lilith Fund is seeking applicants to join our Board of Directors! Our volunteer board of directors serves as a governing board that provides organizational and financial oversight, strategic governance, visioning, and support to our staff. 

We are looking for motivated people who are passionate about reproductive justice and excited to put in time and effort to expand abortion access for Texans, and who reside in our primary service area of the southern half of Texas. Reproductive justice is defined by SisterSong as “the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities.” Applicants must have a demonstrated commitment to social justice, racial equity, and reproductive justice, and strong interest in furthering Lilith Fund’s vision and anti-racist values. Our board meets monthly via video conference call and periodically in-person throughout our service area (primarily Houston, San Antonio, and Austin).
