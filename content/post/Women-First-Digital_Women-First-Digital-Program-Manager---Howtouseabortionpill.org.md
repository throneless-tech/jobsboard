The digital revolution is transforming how more than 4.5 billion people access sexual and reproductive health care and information. The increasing use of technology provides a unique opportunity to reach vulnerable populations that are excluded from traditional healthcare systems or burdened by geographic barriers, high costs, and stigma. Women and young people increasingly turn to the internet as the first touch-point for information, including guidance about reproductive health and abortion information.

Women First Digital (WFD) is an eHealth social enterprise that operates HowToUseAbortionPill.org (HowToUse). At WFD, we believe in leveraging the power of the digital revolution to ensure that all women, regardless of where they live, have access to a safe abortion option.
