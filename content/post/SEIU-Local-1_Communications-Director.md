SEIU Local 1 has been on the cutting edge of building power for working people in service industries and fighting for economic, immigrant, racial and environmental justice. We are looking to hire a Communications Director in Chicago to work on exciting campaigns and oversee communications efforts across six states. The Communications Director will ensure that the Local develops and implements a robust communications program, internally with members and staff and externally (e.g., earned, and social media) to effectively convey Local 1â€™s key messages and help win for workers throughout the Midwest.
