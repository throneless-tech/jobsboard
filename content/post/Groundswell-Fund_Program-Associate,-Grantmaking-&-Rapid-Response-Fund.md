The Program Associate is responsible for supporting Groundswellâ€™s Grantmaking Department, including supporting grantmaking as needed across five funds: Catalyst Fund, Liberation Fund, Rapid Response Fund, Black Trans Fund, and Birth Justice Fund, two special project initiatives focused on Healing Justice and Climate Justice, as well as supporting grants management through our capacity-building programs. Working closely with the rest of the Grantmaking and Capacity Building Teams, the Program Assistant contributes to the implementation of grantmaking, grants management, technical assistance, evaluation, communications, and funder organizing efforts, while supporting and fostering key relationships with our funder colleagues, individual donors, grantees, and other key partners. This role will predominately provide grantmaking support to the Rapid Response Fund, support cross team coordination and grantmaking, and lead general Grantmaking Department administrative support and scheduling.
