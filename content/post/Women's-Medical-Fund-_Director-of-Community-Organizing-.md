WMF (new name coming soon!) is committed to ensuring and expanding abortion access through direct service and community organzing. We aim for this work to be Black-led and centered. The Director of Community Organizing (DCO) will oversee all aspects of WMFâ€™s community organizing efforts. Their primary role is to mobilize individuals most impacted by abortion restrictions, namely Black, Brown, and Indigenous individuals who can become pregnant and are living in poverty; as well as young people, gender non-conforming individuals, immigrants, disabled individuals, and those who live at the intersections of these experiences. The DCO works  closely with the ED and other staff.
