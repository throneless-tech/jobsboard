The Family Planning Council of Iowa (FPCI) is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing quality reproductive healthcare and family planning services to all people in Iowa who desire it. We provide this care by delegating Title X (ten) funds from the federal government, subcontracting with clinics and other facilities to provide sexual and reproductive healthcare services to low-income individuals in local communities. This federal grant-funded position coordinates and oversees the clinical component of FPCIâ€™s Title X program, including monitoring, reporting, training, and educating. For more information about the work that we do, please visit: www.fpcouncil.org.
