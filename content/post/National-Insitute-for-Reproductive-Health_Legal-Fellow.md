The National Institute for Reproductive Health (NIRH) and the National Institute for Reproductive Health Action Fund (NIRH Action Fund), advocacy groups that fight for just and equitable access to reproductive health care, are seeking a full-time Legal Fellow to work with the organization for a calendar year to help them in building political power for reproductive freedom. 

This is a benefits eligible, full-time, non-exempt position that will require 35 hours of work, with flexibility, during normal business hours, Monday to Friday 10 AM to 6 PM. The annual salary for this position is between $65,000 to $75,000, commensurate with experience. 

Reporting to the Director of Policy, the Legal Fellow will work closely with NIRH’s Department of Programs and Partnerships, providing legal research and policy analysis to support work with organizations throughout the country working to advance reproductive health, rights, and justice, with a particular emphasis on efforts to expand abortion access through ballot initiatives.  This person will play an integral role with our state and local level initiatives, supporting state and local partners to develop and support ballot initiatives and proactive policy development.  This staff person will be joining a team that’s engaged in shifting its social justice framework to center racial equity as a core priority, as NIRH staff and board have committed to racial equity and have been engaged in a multi-year process to adopt a racial equity lens across the organization. 

This is a remote position. However, applicants located in the Washington DC Metro area are strongly encouraged to apply.
