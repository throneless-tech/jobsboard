Just The Pill is seeking a Finance and Operations Director to join our team. This is a unique opportunity to join a rapidly growing organization started by front line abortion workers that is expanding access to reproductive health services in ways never before attempted. This position will be a part of the executive team and its primary function is to lead the rollout of two dozen mobile clinics in several states. While this position is fully remote, this role will travel to Minneapolis and Illinois and be charged with developing relationships within the community as well as overseeing physical spaces. This demands infrastructure development—staffing and logistics—as well as relationships development— we want mutually-beneficial partnerships with local clinics, funds, and advocacy organizations.
