IWPR seeks a Managing Director to lead its new research center, The Center on the Economics of Reproductive Health (CERH). The Managing Director will oversee IWPR’s currently-funded work in this area and fundraise to support new research as well as policy and outreach initiatives to raise awareness of the importance of access to reproductive health services for women’s economic and overall well-being. They will engage in strategic thinking to determine the value CERH can add to the research and policy spaces around reproductive health and develop a cohesive research and policy agenda. They will also position CERH as a hub for high-quality research in this area and a go-to source for policymakers, advocates, and others seeking to advance reproductive justice for all women.
