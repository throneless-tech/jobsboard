The Senior Birth Equity Research Analyst will be the higher level staff of the Research & Strategy Team, reporting to its Director and VP. They will be an internal expert on research methodology by colleagues, while working through the Team’s more rapidly cycling subcontracts. The senior analyst will be able to either collect, analyze or write about the research, but will not be responsible for multi-year grant projects.  They will assist other Teams in their research requests. Their writing products raise NBEC’s profile, whether they are conference abstracts, academic manuscripts, or data translations for public consumption.
