Reporting to Director, Abortion Access Funding and working closely with the Senior Director, Abortion Access Strategy, as well as the CAPS team and Health Care Operations team, this position will support the expansion and implementation of abortion funding programs at the national level. Because financial barriers are among the most commonly cited barriers to abortion access, this position will focus on supporting programs and policies that remove that barrier for our patients. Through regular communication with Planned Parenthood affiliates, this position will be integral in supporting the implementation of direct patient support funds for abortion services, as well as ensuring the compliance and uniform adminsitration of these funds throughout the Federation. This role requires a depth and breadth of knowledge about the barriers and facilitators of equitable abortion access and care in the United States, encompassing issues of financial barriers, service availability and delivery, and abortion policies and restrictions. This role also requires a proven ability to build and execute trainings, manage and improve data collection/analysis, work independently and with a team, and communicate information effectively among geographically and culturally diverse stakeholders. The successful candidate will possess a high level of emotional intelligence, ability to think and act proactively and strategically, and the ability to remain organized, attentive to detail, and efficient in a fast-paced and rapidly evolving landscape.
