We are a start-up, non-profit health and wellness center in Northern Virginia seeking two (2) Advanced Practice Providers to provide comprehensive GYN and reproductive healthcare including abortion services. We're looking for someone with at least 3-5 years of experience in their practitioner position (3-5 years of abortion experience not necessary) who will work under the supervision of our medical director. Our ideal candidate is someone who can use their experience to help us build something new. We are looking for our new hires to start at the beginning of May, and we're working to open our doors to patients in June.
