The Katz Amsterdam Foundation (KAF) is pleased to invite nominations and applications for the position of Civic Engagement/Reproductive Health Program Director. The Katz Amsterdam Foundation strives to be a catalyst for eliminating inequities, increasing access to opportunity, and improving outcomes for all. The Foundation has spent the first few years focused on striving to address inequities in three key issue areas:  mental and behavioral health, civic engagement, and now reproductive health. There have been long-standing racial disparities in each of these issue areas, and KAF utilizes a racial equity lens to help address those disparities. The ideal candidate will bring a strong commitment to social justice and the mission of KAF as well as experience and dedication to the core areas of civic engagement and reproductive health and rights. They will bring an innovative and strategic mindset as a natural connector who can engage and articulate impact.
