The Raíz Organizer will work closely with other organizers, the Georgia Public Policy and Organizing Manager, and the entire Public Policy and Organizing team to effectively run a grassroots organizing program. The Raíz Organizer will work in close coordination with Planned Parenthood’s national organizing team, engage and grow a base of Latinx supporters, and build power for the reproductive health movement in the Latinx community. The Raíz Organizer will work with the Georgia Public Policy and Organizing Manager to formalize and streamline grassroots organizing activities while building capacity and infrastructure, deepening Latinx engagement at the local level. During election cycles, organizers will work to register voters, persuade voters to turnout, message in communities on behalf of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates’ endorsed candidates, and participate in a “Get Out The Vote” program.
