The RAIZ Organizing program is a part of Planned Parenthoodâ€™s national effort to work with Latinx communities on increasing involvement in sex education, sexual and reproductive health advocacy and increasing access care. Planned Parenthood of Michigan is seeking a program organizer to build a sustainable, community-organizing program in partnership with Latinx communities across the state. Successful candidates will ensure the centering of Latinx communities in the reproductive health and abortion access narrative, engage Latinx leaders and storytellers, and support communities to advocate for sexual and reproductive healthcare and abortion access.  The program organizer will build, expand and deepen relationships with partner organizations to ensure we are a part of and contribute to an inclusive and intersectional advocacy community.
