Hey Jane is a digital clinic serving womxn’s most impactful health needs. We’re starting by tackling one of the most common, yet most stigmatized, treatments: abortion. One in four womxn will get an abortion in their lives, but the treatment today is inaccessible, needlessly expensive and incomparably stigmatized. With Hey Jane, patients consult with licensed providers online to have the same FDA-approved abortion pills they'd get in a clinic shipped to their doorstep -- conveniently, discreetly and at half the price of traditional care. We are currently expanding our clinical team and looking for experienced abortion providers open to telehealth work. 

We are looking for an experienced RN with an active CA license to join our Patient Support team working directly with our patients and clinicians through each step of the process: intake, support and follow-up! We are a telehealth team, so join us from the comfort of your own home to help us grow in 2022!
