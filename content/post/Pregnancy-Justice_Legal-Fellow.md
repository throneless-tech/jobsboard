Pregnancy Justice seeks applicants for the position of Law Fellow to begin in the Fall of 2024. If selected, the candidate will work with Pregnancy Justice to apply for funding through an external fellowship funder (such as Skadden, Equal Justice Works, Justice Catalyst, a law school fellowship, or other public interest law fellowship). Candidates should identify potential sources of funding before applying but do not need to have secured such funding at the time of application submission. Pregnancy Justice will supplement the funding provided by the external fellowship funder to compensate the fellow at $76,320, commensurate with our pay scale.

The Law Fellow will design the project in conjunction with Pregnancy Justiceâ€™s staff attorneys and Acting Executive Director. As a small and dynamic non-profit organization, Pregnancy Justice offers Law Fellows the opportunity to undertake significant legal work, community organizing and policy advocacy, media writing, and public speaking, and the opportunity to attend conferences and make site visits to clients.
