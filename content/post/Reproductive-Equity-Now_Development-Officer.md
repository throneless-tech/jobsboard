Reproductive Equity Now (REN) seeks a full-time (40 hours per week) Development Officer to oversee and execute fundraising initiatives for our rapidly growing organization. This position is ideal for someone who has a passion for reproductive equity, a broad base knowledge of
development, and a drive to professionally learn and grow. Reporting to the Director of Development, the Development Officer will help expand Reproductive Equity Nowâ€™s footprint throughout New England and ensure the organization has a diverse and robust base of support. Since 1972, Reproductive Equity Now has led the way in advancing reproductive freedom in the Commonwealth. After recently rebranding our organization, we are on a path to regional expansion. Our mission is to make equitable access to the full spectrum of reproductive health care a reality for all people regardless of their race, ethnicity, income, zip code, gender, age, immigration status, ability, sexual orientation, or religion. Advancing reproductive justice and
eliminating barriers to safe, legal abortion care are also central to that mission.
