The Associate General Counsel (Governance and Compliance) is responsible for providing nuanced, practical, and values-aligned legal information and advice to support the programs, operations, and membership of the National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF). They are attuned to the laws that apply to nonprofit and tax-exempt organizations and how they impact the organization and mission, and serve a key role in identifying, assessing, and managing legal risks and opportunities for NNAF and member abortion funds. 

Together with the Legal Department, they serve as a trusted advisor and thought partner to NNAF’s Board of Directors and across its Departments – particularly the Executive Team, Human Resources, IT, Development, and Operations – to develop and implement strategies and solutions that maintain the health and resiliency of NNAF while centering, and without compromising, its mission and values. 

They also collaborate closely with the Technical Assistance and Movement Building teams to offer technical assistance and support to member abortion funds to build the organizational capacity and resiliency needed to withstand scrutiny and attacks from the opposition and navigate the constantly shifting abortion access landscape.
