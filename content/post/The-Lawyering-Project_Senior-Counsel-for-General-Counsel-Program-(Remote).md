The Lawyering Project is excited to announce the creation of a pilot program aimed at providing general counsel services to abortion funds, practical support organizations, and other grassroots organizations working to support abortion access.  In the current legal landscape, where states are permitted to ban or severely restrict abortion access, these groups are going to play a huge role in helping people obtain abortion care across state lines.  They will need legal support to help them meet the evolving needs of abortion patients, but many lack the resources to hire in-house or outside counsel.  Our General Counsel Program will offer these grassroots organizations the kind of legal advice that an in-house counsel would typically provide. We are seeking an experienced attorney to lead this pilot program, which will be housed in our Access & Innovation Program. The Senior Counsel for General Counsel Program will play a key role in designing and implementing the Lawyering Projectâ€™s General Counsel Program and will be responsible for managing its day-to-day operations.
