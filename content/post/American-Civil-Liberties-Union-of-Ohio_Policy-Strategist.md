The ACLU of Ohio seeks a Policy Strategist who will be conducting legislative research and analyzing the policies that affect and impact everyday Ohioans. The successful candidate will be equally as comfortable persuading local, state, and federal lawmakers to improve legislation as they are building alliances with coalition partners and stakeholders across the entirety of the political spectrum. A thinker is who we are searching for; someone with vision, capable of developing and implementing integrated strategies that advance the ACLU of Ohioâ€™s mission of preserving, protecting, and expanding civil liberties, civil rights, and racial justice. This requires sensitivity, persuasiveness, and creative problem solving to balance competing interests.
