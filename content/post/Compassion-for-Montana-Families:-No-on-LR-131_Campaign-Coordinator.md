Position summary: The Montana LR-131 opposition coalition is recruiting a campaign coordinator to lead the coordination of organizations and individuals working together to oppose LR-131. The campaign coordinator will work closely with the campaign manager and the steering committee to support campaign logistics and operations, including managing communications and organizing meetings with coalition members and external partners. The campaign coordinator will also serve as our coalition’s state lead of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center’s (BISC) pilot program for their Declaration of Equity and Accountability toolkit and process (DOE). The role of the campaign coordinator in this pilot program will be to facilitate our coalition’s integration of equitable and inclusive practices into the ballot initiative process (additional background information about this program is provided below). This individual will also receive direct coaching, guidance, and support from the BISC team to bolster and sustain capacity at the state-level for ongoing work on progressive issues. We view this campaign coordinator position as an investment in Montana and an opportunity to build longer-term grassroots power, capacity for integrating equity and accountability within progressive movements, and a stronger ballot infrastructure in our state.

This position will be housed at Montana Women Vote (MWV), a non-profit organization based in Missoula; MWV is committed to increasing participation in all aspects of democracy. While MWV will provide administrative and logistical support to the campaign coordinator, the position will report to and will work closely with the coalition’s steering committee throughout and immediately following the duration of the campaign.

- Foster collaboration and alignment among the steering committee and coalition members through clear and effective communication and regular facilitated meetings
- Support the development and implementation of campaign strategy and activities

- Work with coalition members to develop and strengthen their leadership skills and organizational capacity through an equity lens
- Work closely with the coalition steering committee and members to: understand the history, dynamics, values, and priorities of the coalition; define and help lead the process for implementing the DOE; select the components of the ballot measure process to prioritize; and identify the practices and commitments the members of the coalition will make to one another.
- Join bi-weekly or monthly meetings with the BISC team to receive coaching, guidance, and support for the implementation of the DOE within the coalition

Preferred qualifications:
- Commitment to understanding the varied perspectives, experiences, and cultures that make up Montana
- Commitment to anti-racism, dismantling white supremacy, and equity
- Experience in progressive movement building and coalitions, grassroots organizing, and reproductive rights in Montana
- Knowledge of and/or experience in ballot measures

Salary and Benefits:
- $7,500 per month for full-time, 40 hours per week. Part-time will be prorated.
- This position is salary and exempt.
- Benefits include: fully paid health insurance, generous PTO, tech stipend.
- Position can be negotiated as a contract employee if desired.

This position will be open until filled, and the first deadline for review will be July 11th.

Additional background information for your reference: The Montana LR-131 opposition coalition is a group of grassroots organizations, community members, activists, and healthcare providers that are working together to oppose Montana LR-131 - Montana LR-131, Medical Care Requirements for Born-Alive Infants Measure, and also known as the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act. The purpose of this coalition is to proactively develop and disseminate unified messages to oppose LR-131 through relationship building, community leadership and engagement, and storytelling. Messages will focus on raising awareness about the true harmful impact of this policy, the extremist agenda behind this referendum, the harms of government overreach into private medical decision-making, and will center the human right to accessing sexual and reproductive healthcare.

Our coalition is partnering with the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center (BISC) to implement their Declaration of Equity and Accountability in Ballot Measure Campaigns (DOE) process and toolkit. BISC is a national progressive organization that works across policy, organizing, and political organizations in collaboration with local, state, and national leaders to analyze and support ballot measures. Their mission is to strengthen democracy by implementing a national progressive strategy for ballot measures rooted in building state-based power, and they do so through capacity building, legal and policy advocacy, long-term strategy and planning, and research. BISC’s goal is to help progressive movements develop accountability practices that disrupt race, power, and privilege dynamics that are rooted in white supremacy culture.
The DOE process and toolkit is designed to be used by campaigns, coalitions, and any groups that may be making strategic decisions in a ballot measure process to shift campaign and coalition culture from transactional to transformational. The DOE helps partners to identify and embed equitable and inclusive practices into different components of ballot measure campaigns and to develop accountability practices that disrupt the race, power, and privilege dynamics that are rooted in white supremacy culture. Specifically, the DOE is an agreement that partners within a coalition make with one another which details the commitments and the practices they will embrace to ensure an equitable and impactful effort. Within this framework, BISC employs an expanded definition of winning in which a successful campaign is measured by what it leaves behind in terms of strong organizations, rising leadership, and grassroots power.

The Montana LR-131 opposition coalition is one of BISC’s five 2022 DoE Pilot Programs which will implement the DOE process, develop shared principles and practices, and conduct ongoing work to hold themselves accountable.
