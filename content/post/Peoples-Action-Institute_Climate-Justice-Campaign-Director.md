The climate crisis is the issue of our time - without addressing it head on, nothing else will matter. People’s Action is addressing this from the ground up...rooted in the experiences of people and communities on the frontline of the crisis. This position offers the right person the opportunity to organize with a powerful group of organizations across the country that are on the cutting edge of proposing, winning, and implementing solutions to the climate crisis - solutions that benefit people and the planet over profit. 

People’s Action/ Institute member groups have a track record of leadership in coordinating field mobilization and advocacy in advancing policies for a 100% Just Transition – e.g. playing frontline leadership roles in fights for cutting edge legislation like the IL Clean Energy Jobs Act (CEJA) and the NY Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA, not exactly what our groups were pushing for in terms of justice, but still some of the boldest climate change legislation out there!), as well as winning concrete resources for families and communities.
