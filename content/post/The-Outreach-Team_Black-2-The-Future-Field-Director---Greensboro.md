We are hiring Field Directors to work on a survey campaign to engage Black voters (and non-voters) across North Carolina. Our campaign aims to build Black political power by engaging our communities, centering issues most important to those communities, educating and organizing around those issues, and transforming Black communities into constituencies that impact policy to better serve our needs and dreams in the city and statewide.

Field Directors will recruit, train, and manage a team of local canvassers to engage with voters in Black communities in Greensboro. Additionally, the Lead Campaign Director will manage a team of two or more Deputy Directors and will be responsible for building an office to scale from the ground up. This position reports to the Project Director.
