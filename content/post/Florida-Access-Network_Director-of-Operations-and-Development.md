Reporting to the Executive Director, the Director of Operations and Development (DOD) will be responsible for financial management and budget/forecast planning, operational planning and priority setting, oversight of technology and information services, contracts and vendor relationships, human resources, and internal policy development and compliance for FAN. Equally as important, they have a key leadership role in colleague engagement and organizational culture for the staff.

This full-time, exempt position works closely with Florida Access Network’s staff, all of whom work remotely, and supervises the administrative, operations, and fund development functions. They also interact regularly with the Board of Directors and other partners. While this position will be based remotely in the State of Florida, this role will be expected to participate in in-person activities and tasks within Orlando a few times per month.

Ideal candidates will connect deeply with FAN’s mission, vision, and values. A successful DOD will have comprehensive nonprofit operations administration knowledge and hands-on experience with organizational budgets, and finances. In addition, they will have strong conceptual, analytical, problem-solving, and independent thinking skills. Experience with non-profit or foundation/grantmaking organizations is required, and prior experience working in the reproductive justice space is a plus.

The expected starting annual salary range for this position is $80,000. The position will remain open until filled.
