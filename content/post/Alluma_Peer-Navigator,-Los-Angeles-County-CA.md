We are looking for a Peer Navigator to join our team to empower communities and service providers with One Degree and get poverty-fighting resources into the hands of low-income and at-risk Los Angeles County residents. We are looking for someone with lived experience navigating community services to support and encourage our community members in using One Degree to find and utilize life empowering resources. This is a great opportunity for someone who is a natural at community outreach, community engagement and relationship building.
