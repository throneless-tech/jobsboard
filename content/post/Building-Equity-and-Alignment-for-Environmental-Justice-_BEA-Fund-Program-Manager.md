The Program Manager (PM) will be responsible for the overall management of the BEA Fund.  This person will be the key point of contact and support for grantee partners and administer the Fundâ€™s new technical assistance program. In this role, the PM will also work closely with Steering Committee members, Grant Review Committee members and staff to ensure that resources reach historically under resourced environmental justice grassroots groups.  The PM will become the fifth full-time member of our staff and will support other programmatic work where needed.
