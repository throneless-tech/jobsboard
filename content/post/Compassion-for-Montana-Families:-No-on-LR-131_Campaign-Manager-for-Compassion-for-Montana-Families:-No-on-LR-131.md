Campaign overview and position summary: Compassion for Montana Families: No on LR-131 is a group of grassroots organizations, community members, activists, and healthcare providers working together to oppose Montana LR-131, Medical Care Requirements for Born-Alive Infants Measure, also known as the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act. The purpose of this coalition is to proactively develop and disseminate unified messages to oppose LR-131 through relationship building, community leadership and engagement, and storytelling. The campaign will focus on raising awareness about the harmful impacts of this policy on Montana families, the extremist agenda behind this referendum, the harms of government overreach into private medical decision-making, and will center the human right to accessing sexual and reproductive healthcare. We are recruiting a campaign manager to lead the development and implementation of a statewide campaign to defeat the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act on the November 2022 ballot. The campaign manager will work closely with the steering committee and a campaign coordinator to engage a broad coalition of partners to ensure the inclusive development and broad dissemination of unified messages to Montanans.
