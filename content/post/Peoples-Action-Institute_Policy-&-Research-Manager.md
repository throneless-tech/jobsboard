This position is a dream job for someone who loves policy and research, is interested in the interplay between federal & state & local policy, appreciates working across multiple issue areas yet with a common theme of equitable development to combat structural racism, wants policy and research to be in service to state and local power-building organizations, wants to be in relationship with multiple partners and players in the field, and has the energy to vision and build out an array of policy support for both member organizations and the collective.
