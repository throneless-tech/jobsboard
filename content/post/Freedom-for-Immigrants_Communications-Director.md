Freedom for Immigrants is looking for a skilled communicator to develop effective messaging strategies that promote narrative change as part of our collective work to abolish immigration detention.  The Communications Director plays a critical role developing and driving the media strategy for our local, state and national campaigns and ongoing advocacy efforts.  We are committed to working directly with impacted people and centering the voices of people who are in detention or have been formerly detained in our decision making and strategic communications.  Our organization works with volunteers and local groups across the country and, as such, the right candidate will deeply value partnership and collaboration while having a keen and persistent ability to uplift the work of our staff and network in the fight to abolish detention.
