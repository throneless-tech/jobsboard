Gender Justice is seeking a dedicated, passionate, talented UnRestrict Minnesota Senior Campaign Manager to manage a multi-racial, cross-sector campaign and 32-member coalition to educate and engage Minnesotans on abortion restrictions and reproductive justice in Minnesota, advocate for reproductive freedom at the Minnesota Legislature, and support on-going litigation aimed at striking down the current abortion restrictions. With our recent wins at the MN State Legislature, as well as through our lawsuit to remove Minnesotaâ€™s restrictions on abortion, this is a potent and powerful time to lead and build the movement for reproductive freedom. A successful Senior Campaign Manager will be adept at working both with a high level of autonomy and also collaboratively with colleagues and coalition partners.
