The Reproductive Justice Unit at the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office is hiring legal interns for the spring 2024 semester. The internship is unpaid; however, it is designed for students currently enrolled in law school who are eligible to earn course credit for their time with the Office.  The Reproductive Justice Unit (“RJU”) is charged with ensuring the Commonwealth remains a leader in pursuit of reproductive justice. As such, the unit’s work is intersectional, community informed, and collaborative by nature. Students interning with the RJU are likely to work on a range of matters.  Duties include:  implementation of the state’s reproductive health and gender-affirming care SHIELD Law; addressing the misinformation and harm caused by crisis pregnancy centers; ensuring meaningful access to sexual and reproductive health care; addressing the growing disparities in maternal health outcomes; examining legislative priorities and conducting related legal research working with community partners and stakeholders; developing public education tools, including know your rights materials, AGO guidance, and communications materials. The timing of the spring internship will correspond with the student’s academic semester. Internships are available on a part-time and full-time basis. While the AGO is on a hybrid schedule, students do not have to be in Boston to apply, and the RJU can accommodate remote schedules.  To apply, please submit a resume and cover letter stating your interest in the RJU and availability to the Director of the unit, Sapna Khatri, at sapna.khatri@mass.gov  Please note that we are actively recruiting interns at this time, and we recommend submitting your application materials early! We expect all interns to be finalized and notified no later than Jan. 15th.  The Attorney General's Office is an Equal Opportunity Employer.  As the representative of the Commonwealth and its residents, the Attorney General's Office strives to ensure that those working in our office reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. The Office encourages applicants from a broad spectrum of backgrounds to apply for positions.
