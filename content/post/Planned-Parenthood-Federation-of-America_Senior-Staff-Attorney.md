PPL&L represents PPFA and Planned Parenthood affiliates in policy matters that affect the mission of the organization. We conduct litigation in state and federal courts across the country, and we provide legal advice to PPFA and Planned Parenthood affiliates about legal issues such as pending legislation, regulatory matters, and activities of those opposed to Planned Parenthood that interfere with our ability to provide comprehensive reproductive health care. Reporting to one of the Senior Directors of PPL&L, the Senior Staff Attorneyâ€™s primary responsibilities revolve around conducting significant and high visibility litigation on behalf of PPFA or Planned Parenthood affiliates. The Senior Staff Attorney will also be engaged in work related to pending legislation and regulatory matters.
