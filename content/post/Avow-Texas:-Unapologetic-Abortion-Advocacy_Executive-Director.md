Avow’s next Executive Director will lead its work to advance abortion rights for all Texans. For this pivotal role, Avow seeks a visionary, pro-abortion leader and spokesperson who will prioritize those most marginalized by abortion restrictions and inspire a wide range of supporters, funders, decision-makers, and stakeholders at the local and state levels to build a world where all Texans can access abortion for any reason.  The Executive Director will be a bold and inclusive leader with a clear understanding and commitment to reproductive justice and intersectional principles, both externally (through Avow’s programmatic work) and internally (with respect to organizational policies, staff wellbeing, and a collective mindset). They will be adept at working strategically in a politically challenging environment and balancing the internal and external demands of the position for themselves, the Avow staff, and the Board.  The Executive Director will work with a passionate and committed staff of nine, each of whom brings deep expertise in their field. They will report into and work with a c3 Board and a c4 Board and manage a PAC (in consultation with the PAC assistant treasurer).
