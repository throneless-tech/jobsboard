The Opportunity

We are looking for a seasoned campaigner and organizer with a strong track record and belief in the necessity of both local and national campaigns - and the interplay between them - to win climate justice at the scale and speed that the crisis requires. 


Overview of the Position

The Climate Justice Senior Strategist will work at the behest of our grassroots affiliates to drive razor-sharp local and state campaigns that leverage the Inflation Reduction Act to win climate, jobs, and justice while helping to develop and implement a national campaign that takes on the corporations at the root of the crisis. You will ensure that all campaign work advances a base and power-building strategy, as that is at the center of everything that we do.
