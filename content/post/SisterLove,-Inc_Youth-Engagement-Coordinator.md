Healthy Love Youth Advocates (HLYA) is a grassroots network of youth, ages
16-25, throughout the State of Georgia willing to take action to support young
people’s rights to comprehensive reproductive sexual health information and
services. Through online media, face-to-face meetings, and intensive trainings,
SisterLove provides these young people with information and builds their skills on
issues such as reproductive and sexual health, advocacy, media outreach, and
youth organizing, among other topics, in order to create an active and mobilized
network of young activists willing to conduct cultural and political advocacy. Under
the supervision of the Policy and Advocacy Program Manager, the Youth
Engagement Coordinator will assist in efforts to expand, engage, and mobilize
SisterLove’s Healthy Love Youth Advocates and will support and implement
programming for SisterLove’s youth-based initiatives, such as HLYASS (Health
Love Youth Advocates Statewide Summit) and PrEPFlix & Chill.
