The RHSC was established to develop curriculum around comprehensive reproductive health care training, including abortion care to scope of practice for various health care professionals throughout the state. As a part of our work on this project, NSRH is coordinating the development of education for Doulas, RNs, LVNs, Medical Assistants, Paramedics, and Community Health Workers.
