Are you a feminist nurse practitioner? Would you like to be part of a client-centered health care model that allows longer visits with an emphasis on prevention and health education? Is providing care that is fat-positive, trauma-informed and guided by harm-reduction important to you?  CWHC has taken part in radical client-centered care for the past 45 plus years. The Advanced Practice Nurseâ€™s focus will be to provide direct primary care to clients, including addressing mental health concerns within primary care visits and in collaboration with Counseling and Integrative Health Services. Practitioners will work with a team of health educators and volunteer physicians to provide care in the areas of gynecology, alternative insemination and transgender hormone therapy.
