MOVE is seeking its next Executive Director, replacing its founding director, to develop and execute strategy towards state governing power. This will require investing in deep partnership with the board of directors, managing a growing team to catalyze coordinated strategy across the state, and working directly with member organizations leading voter engagement and organizing efforts across Missouri on campaigns at the national, state, and local levels. Members of MOVE and MOVE Action are active in every corner of the state with voters who run the gamut of political ideology, and MOVEâ€™s next leader will be prepared to navigate this complicated and diverse political terrain, providing the leadership to execute the financial and technical support to help critical campaigns succeed. The Executive Director will also play a key role in championing the work of MOVE and MOVE Action members and aligning other progressive leaders in the Missouri progressive ecosystem with our 1.6 million governing majority goal.
