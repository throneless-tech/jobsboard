The ACLU of Connecticut is looking for our next digital content strategist. At the ACLU-CT, we're focused on fighting to end mass incarceration, reduce policing, expand voting rights, increase LGBTQ+ equity, and create racial justice. Some of the things we're advocating for right now include the Connecticut Voting Rights Act, early voting, banning police deceptive interrogations of children, ongoing inclusion of trans student athletes in sports, and abolishing prison debt. We're seeking a full-time digital content strategist to create and manage the organizationâ€™s social media presence and digital content. This is a fantastic opportunity for a communications professional to play a key role in strategizing around and creating digital content to further our litigation, organizing, and advocacy programs. This is a full-time, exempt position based out of our Hartford, CT office; unless conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic result in restrictions on in-office attendance, the digital content strategist will be expected to be in Hartford, CT at least one day per week. Salary is between $50,000-$65,000 annually, depending on experience. The ACLU of Connecticut also offers a generous and comprehensive benefits package including four weeks paid vacation; 100%-employer premium paid medical, dental, and vision insurance, as well as a supplemental wellness benefit; 401(k) Plan including up to 5.5% employer contribution; and 13 paid holidays.
