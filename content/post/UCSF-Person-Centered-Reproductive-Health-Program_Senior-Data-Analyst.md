The Person-Centered Reproductive Health Program (PCRHP) within the UCSF Department of Family & Community Medicine seeks a Senior Data Analyst to collaborate on a portfolio of projects related to performance measurement in contraceptive care including studies to evaluate the validity and reliability of electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs) for contraceptive care, the validity of the Self-Identified Need for Contraception (SINC) service delivery needs question, and the Person-Centered Contraceptive Counseling (PCCC) measure. In addition the incumbent will work on a project to explore the tandem use of eCQMs and a PCCC in a Quality Improvement project targeted to Community Health Centers. This research is supported by federal funding from the Department of Health of Human Services, Office of Population Affairs (OPA) and private, anonymous foundation funding. The Senior Data Analyst will also support data and analysis needs of other PCRHP projects. The PCRHP aims to advance reproductive autonomy and well-being by conducting research and designing programs that center people’s experiences and preferences for sexual and reproductive health and health care, guided by an attention to the intersecting oppressions and structural injustices that impact people’s lives and health.
 
We are looking for someone who is enthusiastic, self-directed, and highly collegial. In particular we are looking for someone with experience and proficiency working with EHR reporting, including analyzing, managing, mapping, and querying clinical data in EHR systems, and experience with code systems used in EHRs like RHNORM, SNOWMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10-CM, CPT, and NDC. A commitment to reproductive health quality, equity and justice is highly desired. Excellent communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively on a team are imperative.
