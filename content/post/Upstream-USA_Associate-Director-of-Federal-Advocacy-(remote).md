Upstream recently formed a new national team focused on federal policy.  We are excited that this team is now growing, and we are looking for an Associate Director of Federal Advocacy to join our organization as a lynchpin on our three-person federal policy team. Reporting to our Director of Federal Policy & Advocacy, our Associate Director will serve as a valued thought partner and will lead strategy and execution for one or more areas of policy advocacy (administrative or legislative), and will help establish and maintain strong relationships with Congressional staff, Administration officials, and fellow advocacy groups.

Our Associate Director of Federal Advocacy will be responsible for independently creating the strategy and leading the execution of advocacy plans related to gaps in contraceptive care that are identified by Upstream’s work with healthcare providers  Duties on our federal policy team will be divided up largely by policy issue area and our new Associate Director may lead several    federal policy topics related to contraceptive care at any given time, depending on the scope of the strategy and the timeline of the campaign. Our Associate Director of Federal Advocacy will also be responsible for leading some of Upstream’s external relationships with fellow advocacy groups, Congressional staff, and Administration officials (primarily within CMS and HRSA). This person will also help coordinate with other departments at Upstream, including sourcing policy issues and communicating policy solutions to Upstream staff who work with our health center partners.
