In Michigan, this effort will focus on organizing young people on campuses and the surrounding communities to bring progressive change to government through voting. Our work will engage young people in voter registration efforts, volunteer recruitment, and pledging young people to vote. Organizers need to be comfortable and confident in: mobilizing their own community, growing their network to include new volunteers to train, and motivating community leaders to help register and mobilize their own networks. Organizers are directly responsible for managing a team of volunteers in their region to hit weekly and phase metric goals. 

This role is available in the following locations: 
- Detroit, Wayne State University
- East Lansing, Michigan State University
- Ann Arbor, University of Michigan
- Grand Rapids/Allendale, Grand Valley State
