Launched in 2020, Abundance Strategiesâ€™ Fundraising Fellowship trains, mentors, and supports the next generation of fundraising professionals. We believe that developing an inclusive pipeline of fundraisers and supporting young fundraising professionals is critical to the success of the progressive movement. We strongly encourage people from diverse backgrounds including people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, disabled people, veterans, and others from historically underrepresented communities to apply.

Abundance Strategies works with an expansive portfolio of progressive nonprofits addressing issues such as climate change, democracy, economic policy, reproductive justice, community economic development, healthcare justice, and much more.

Our immersive program provides fellows with a holistic understanding of the fundraising field and helps to develop important skill sets. It also offers an opportunity to connect with other development professionals. Fellows are trained on prospect research, foundation and corporate fundraising, development communications, cultivation and stewardship, and events and immediately put that training to use.

In addition to the training and skills development, Fellows work directly with a few Abundance Strategies clients.  As part of this work, Fellows will:
- Attend client and internal team meetings 
- Train with Abundance staff on client engagement 
- Conduct research on high-net-worth individuals, corporate philanthropy, and private foundations 
- Draft meeting agendas, notes, and follow up 
- Draft other client deliverables including communication, emails, and literature 
- Learn and practice essential skills including project management, managing up, effective communication, and database management
