We are looking for an Events & Partner Mobilization Manager to oversee the content strategy and execution of all of Families USA’s external events and activations, including the annual Health Action Conference, to equip national, state and community-based advocates and activists with resources, tools, and technical assistance to advance our project work. Central to this role is an ability to work collaboratively with staff across the organization’s departmental and project teams to ensure partner engagement and activation is aligned with Families USA’s advocacy goals. This includes building internal awareness of best practices in digital and traditional organizing strategies.  As an Event Manager we'll trust you to use your curiosity and creative skills to create unique experiences for our external events that help Families USA build a durable, energized movement of health advocates that can be activated to drive bold policy change.
