First Shift seeks an attorney to provide the full range of direct legal services to First Shift clients regarding issues within our scope. Because of First Shiftâ€™s focus on the prevention of job loss, much of our work with individual clients is pro se and/or pre-litigation.

The staff attorney will also collaborate with other staff to conduct outreach to immigrant and limited English proficient families in D.C. and give Know Your Rights presentations for women and parents working in low-income jobs in D.C.
