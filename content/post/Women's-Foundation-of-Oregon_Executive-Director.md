The Women’s Foundation of Oregon (WFO) was founded in 2014 on the idea that everyone regardless of their gender identity should be able to thrive. Our statewide focus on transformative redistribution of wealth is driven by our core belief that individuals and communities are entitled to self-determination. We create change through our three areas of focus: grantmaking, convening community/organizations, and research. 

Women’s Foundation of Oregon is seeking an innovative, inspiring, and bold leader to be its next Executive Director. This is a unique opportunity to be at the helm of an organization that harnesses the power of collective giving to tackle some of the most challenging issues facing women, girls, and femmes, as WFO evolves in new and exciting ways to work at the intersection of racial and gender justice.
