The Network Scaling Associate is responsible for supporting network capacity, communication,  and strategy for organizational development of member funds, with specific emphasis on skill sharing webinars and learning cohorts to leverage the unique strengths and relationships of the network. The Associate is part of the growing Technical Assistance (TA) team. 

The Network Scaling Associate works in close partnership with the Network Scaling Coordinator, Network Scaling Manager, and the TA Director in supporting the design, development, and implementation of organizational plans to scale the network. They will also work with leaders in member abortion funds, and technical assistance providers for our scaling pilot program. The Network Scaling Associate is committed to bringing a racial, economic, and reproductive justice lens to traditional organizational development competencies.

Examples of NNAF technical assistance include trainings, coaching, provision of templates, frameworks, and informational tools, as well as a variety of other targeted consultative practices to support abortion funds in building up their programmatic and operational infrastructure.
