Medical receptionists are the first point of contact for our patients. Medical receptionists will check patients in and out, answer multi-line phones, make appointments for abortion consultations, procedures, medications, and other family planning services, and provide excellent service to our patients. We are currently looking for a full-time receptionist to work Tuesday through Saturday 8am to 4pm or as business needs require.
