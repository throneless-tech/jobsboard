The Reproductive Telehealth Initiative (publicly known as RHITES - Reproductive Health Initiative for Telehealth Equity & Solutions) is focused on the integration of telehealth for sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH), with a particular emphasis on abortion care, into both the SRH, rights, and justice spaces and telehealth/innovation industry landscape.  The Program Manager will help ensure RHITES is on track to meet its short- and long-term strategic goals by representing RHITES within the reproductive health, rights, and justice communities and identifying gaps and opportunities for action. They will also oversee ongoing projects, manage the website and newsletter, and serve as an administrative liaison between RHITES staff and the Hopewell Fund, RHITESâ€™ fiscal sponsor.
