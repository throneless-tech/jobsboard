DCAF seeks a detail-oriented, creative, adaptable intern to learn and grow with the Communications and Development team. The Communications + Community Intern will have the opportunity to assist with social media content production (Twitter, Threads, Instagram, TikTok, + more), media relations, website management, analytics, merchandise and graphic design, and any other on- or offline campaign DCAF is working on. The intern will need to be imaginative,
self-starting, and unafraid to try new things online. DCAF is also a community organization; we are D.C. based, D.C. grounded, and weâ€™re looking for an intern with a deep commitment to this city. (D.C. natives or those with experience organizing for local, progressive issues should strongly consider applying.)
