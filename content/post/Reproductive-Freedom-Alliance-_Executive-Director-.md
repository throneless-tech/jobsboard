The Reproductive Freedom Alliance is a non-partisan coalition of Governors committed to protecting and expanding reproductive freedom in their states. Launched in February 2023, the Alliance aims to expand access and counter assaults on reproductive freedom by serving as a critical hub for Governors and their staff, sharing best practices and model policies, and coordinating strategies. The Reproductive Freedom Alliance is seeking an inaugural executive director to work closely with gubernatorial senior staff to develop and implement a long-term strategic plan for the Alliance and proactively identify opportunities to further protect and expand reproductive freedom (legislative, budgetary, administrative, executive, and other actions).
