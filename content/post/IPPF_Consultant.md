IPPF is seeking a consultant to lead the development and production of a technical guidance document on abortion self-care. This is an exciting opportunity to work closely with IPPFâ€™s International Medical Advisory Panel (IMAP) to produce an IMAP endorsed Statement on abortion self-care, providing guidance to IPPF and its Member Associations in the development and implementation of abortion self-care programmes and interventions. Work undertaken by the consultant will include a consolidation and summary of available evidence through a desk review and stakeholder consultations; the drafting of a Statement for review by IMAP members and selected IPPF staff; the editing and revision of the Statement to incorporate feedback and inputs; and the production of a final Statement for endorsement by the IMAP.
