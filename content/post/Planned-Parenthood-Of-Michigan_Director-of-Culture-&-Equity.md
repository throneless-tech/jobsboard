Under the supervision of the Chief Experience Officer (CXO), the Director of Culture and Equity will be responsible for maintaining and elevating Planned Parenthood’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work, with a strong focus on assessment of PPMI’s broad range of existing DEI initiatives and innovation for future endeavors. This role will guide the organization and leaders in maintaining a healthy workplace culture in which team members understand DEI concepts and are able to incorporate them in nuanced ways into what they do, how they treat each other, and how they engage with and support the communities we serve. The Director of Culture and Equity will work to scale systems and structures that educate and train team members and hold them accountable for that learning and education. This role intentionally builds collaborative partnerships across the organization to deliver value-added service to leaders and team members in a manner that reflects PPMI workplace values and service standards.   This staff person will fully embody a commitment to race equity; evidenced in all interactions with PPMI colleagues and external stakeholders.
