Write and create for Gender Justice! We educate and share stories at the nexus of policy, legal, and narrative change, and we work hard to find the right writers to put those stories into words, and to find the innovative artists to tell those stories in new ways. We’re looking for writers who can write with creativity and clarity on complex issues, and we’re looking for artists to help us craft new ways to connect with audiences, policy makers, and the movement. Successful candidates will understand intersectionality and have subject matter expertise in Trans and LGBQ issues, gender equity, abortion access and reproductive justice. Those who
live and breathe news, policy, and law will be happiest.
