Funders for Reproductive Equity (FRE) is pleased to seek applications and nominations for the position of its first-ever Communications Director.  Historically, FRE has not had a distinctly public identity but has been proud to serve as an integral piece in the fight for reproductive health, rights, and justice (RHRJ) in this country and as a trusted resource for strengthening RHRJ grantmaking, providing valuable engagement and learning opportunities for its members, and actively organizing RHRJ philanthropy to prioritize intersectional issues within grantmaking.  Now, FRE is well-primed for a more public-facing role that catalyzes all funders, including the broader world of philanthropy beyond RHRJ funders, to center intersectional RHRJ issues. To support these efforts, FRE is hiring a Communications Director who will partner with the Executive Director, FREâ€™s staff team, Board and FRE members to facilitate a collaborative process to develop and implement a communications strategy that will advance thought leadership in philanthropy and foster support for intersectional reproductive equity and justice, centering racial and gender justice.
