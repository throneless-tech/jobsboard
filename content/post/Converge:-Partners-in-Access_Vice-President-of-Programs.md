Converge: Partners in Access is dedicated to ensuring all people can access high quality reproductive and sexual health care services when they need it, how they need it and where they live. As the Mississippi and Tennessee grantee of Title X – the only federal Family Planning Program – we collaborate with state public health agency, health care providers, insurance companies, and community partners to build a health care system that places people at the center of reproductive and sexual health care. The Vice President of Programs will provide leadership for Converge's core program (Title X), sit on the senior management team, build and develop a growing team, and contribute to the overall strategic direction of the organization.
