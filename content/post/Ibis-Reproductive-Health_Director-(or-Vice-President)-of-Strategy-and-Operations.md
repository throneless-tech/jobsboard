Ibis Reproductive Health seeks a creative, collaborative, and dynamic leader to join our Senior Management Team as the Director (or VP) of Strategy and Operations. Over the last five years Ibis has grown significantly. We are extremely proud of our accomplishments since we were founded in 2002, believe our approaches to research and evidence-based advocacy fill an important gap in the reproductive health and rights field, and are committed to doing research and running our organization in ways that advance racial justice.
