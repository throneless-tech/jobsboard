Join the Wave campaign to save access to abortion in Maine! Abortion access is at risk across the nation. Abortion is healthcare and reproductive health is a human right. Our staff will be out in communities across the country talking to supporters, raising critical dollars, and identifying long-term donors for partner groups like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood to protect this fundamental right. Wave Fundraising is looking for talented staff managers to run face-to-face (F2F) fundraising offices to save abortion access. A F2F Office Director is responsible for managing and training a staff of paid fundraisers to hit ambitious membership and fundraising goals on our campaigns. The ideal candidate is eager to get hands-on experience with staff development, fundraising, team building and project management.
