All Due Respect is an attempt to help set new labor standards in the community organizing sector, and to make sure that community organizers get a fair wage and a fair shake—because supporting social justice means supporting the people on the frontlines. Success for us means securing a future in which organizers—especially organizers of color, women, LGBTQ+, those with disabilities, rural, and/or undocumented organizers—are valued and supported as the foundation and the future of the progressive movement. The people who are working day in and day out to build power and win big fights should be paid a living wage, receive good benefits, and work in a culture that supports their livelihoods. Organizers shouldn’t be burning out after a few years, and they shouldn’t have to make impossible choices about their futures and their families because they can’t support themselves.
