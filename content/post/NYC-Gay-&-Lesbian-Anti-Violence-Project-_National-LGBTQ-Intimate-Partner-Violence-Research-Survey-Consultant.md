The New York City Anti-Violence Project (AVP) and its program, the National Coalition for Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP), is seeking a research consultant(s) to design and implement one national survey of LGBTQ peoples’ experiences of reporting intimate partner violence, which will be distributed with the assistance of LGBTQ IPV survivor service providers.

 

The purpose of this survey is to produce three comprehensive reports regarding LGBTQ survivors’ experiences of reporting intimate partner violence (IPV). The survey will be developed in collaboration with AVP staff and governance committee members of the National LGBTQ Intimate Partner Violence Institute (the Institute), and reports authored by AVP staff aiming to shed light on the likelihood of disclosing IPV, repeated experiences of IPV, other types of victimization, and the likelihood of repeat disclosure.
