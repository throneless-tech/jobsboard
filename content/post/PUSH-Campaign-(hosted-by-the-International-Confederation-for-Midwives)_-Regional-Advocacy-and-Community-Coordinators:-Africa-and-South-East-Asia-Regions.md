The PUSH campaign will accelerate progress on reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, advance sexual and reproductive healthcare and rights (SRHR), address key barriers to women’s leadership in the global health workforce, and shift underlying gender norms that undervalue women’s rights, lives and work.

The campaign asks came out of an iterative consultation process that included midwives and key stakeholders from across sectors and regions who collectively agreed these asks were fundamental to achieving the overarching goal. To advance these goals, the campaign seeks to engage two regional campaign coordinators from countries within the Africa and South-East Asia regions in order to advance phase 1 of the PUSH campaign.
