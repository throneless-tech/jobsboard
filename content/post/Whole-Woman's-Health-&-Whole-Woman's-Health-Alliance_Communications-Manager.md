The Communications Manager supports WWH and WWHA in advocacy, litigation, outreach, and patient services efforts to ensure that the organizations are positioned as the most credible, trusted independent abortion provider within major national, regional, and local media outlets; our current and potential supporter base; current and potential patients; national and state coalitions; and more. The core responsibilities of the Communications Manager are to serve as one of the primary media contacts in regions where we have clinics, content collaboration within the Communications Team and cross departmentally, and advance both organizations through traditional communications tools, tactics, and strategies.
