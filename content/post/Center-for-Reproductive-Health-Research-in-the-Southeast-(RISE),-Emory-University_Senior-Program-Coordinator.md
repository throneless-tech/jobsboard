RISE is a collaborative research center that seeks to improve reproductive health and equity of people in the US Southeast through transdisciplinary research that informs social, systems, and policy change (www.rise.emory.edu). The RISE team is hiring a Senior Program Coordinator to contribute to Center operations and administrative needs. Areas of focus include research administration (e.g., contributing to progress reports and funding proposals), center communications (e.g., managing website, social media content, publications, and press releases), budget/finance (e.g., placing orders and tracking expenditures), and training/mentorship (e.g., coordinating training opportunities, meeting with trainees interested in RISE). We encourage you to include a cover letter in your application, and look forward to hearing from you!
