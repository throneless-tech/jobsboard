Provide is seeking a Technical Assistance Specialist with experience designing and delivering tools and training for adult learners to help us build the capacity of frontline healthcare and social service providers to respond to their clients' needs around abortion and other stigmatized services. We are looking for someone who is skilled at identifying and implementing strategies to incorporate the needs and perspective of people with lived experience into content design and who can build and maintain relationships with sites for the purpose of providing ongoing capacity building support. Our ideal candidate has specialized knowledge of the inner workings of healthcare and social service systems and has a strong analysis of how the intersections of systemic oppression (white supremacy, racism, sexism, ableism, classism, transphobia, etc.) negatively impact access to abortion and other stigmatized healthcare.   Black, Indigenous, People of color, women, LGBQIA+, Trans and Nonbinary people, and those with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.  We prioritize applicants from our program states. These states are Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.
