We seek a full-time Free the Pill Project Deputy Director, based in the Cambridge or Oakland office or working remotely in the US, with campaign management and coalition engagement experience who is committed to reproductive health, rights, and justice to oversee the implementation of an ambitious program of work to ensure currently approved and new over-the-counter (OTC) oral contraceptive pills (OCs) in the United States are equitably accessible. The Deputy Director position will manage key aspects of the Free the Pill project, including partnerships with organizations to ensure broad awareness of OCs OTC and provide information and resources to people who could benefit most from OTC access. The individual hired for this position will play a leadership role in the Free the Pill team at Ibis, the Free the Pill coalition, and public-facing efforts to raise awareness about OCs OTC. Competitive candidates will be experienced campaign and coalition leaders who have a proven track record of managing the implementation of complex projects and working and communicating effectively with a diverse group of partners. We seek a candidate who can commit to seeing this project through the next phase of the work which will involve developing new partnerships to ensure the successful implementation of the newly launched, first-ever OTC birth control pill in the United States and laying the groundwork for future OTC switches. The Deputy Director position reports to the Free the Pill Project Director.
