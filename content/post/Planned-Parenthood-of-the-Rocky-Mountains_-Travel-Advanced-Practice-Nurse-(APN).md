In collaboration with PPRM Medical Standards and Guidelines, the Medical Director and state and federal regulations, the Traveling Advanced Practice Clinician (TAPC) will function as a provider of primary reproductive health care services. The TAPC will act as a replacement for clinicians who are unable to work their regularly scheduled hours or for health centers that need a clinician on a temporary basis. In addition, the TAPC will support the Virtual Care Center by providing direct patient care virtually through HIPAA-compliant telehealth platforms and centralized care programs.
