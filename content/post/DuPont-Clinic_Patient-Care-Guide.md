The DuPont Clinic is a referral center for all-trimester abortion and ultrasound-guided procedures, including for abnormal or high risk pregnancies, and for people with complex medical situations who may have difficulty accessing care.Â  
The Patient Care Guide (PCG) serves as an integral part of the team, creating a supportive patient experience and ensuring patient safety. The PCG will report directly to the Associate Manager, Patient Care. PCGs provide unique and extremely valuable care for patients while working in conjunction with physicians, advanced practice clinicians, and nurses. They provide critical informational, emotional, and physical support for patients during their procedures and recovery, as well as assist clinicians and administrative staff with clinic operations. The DuPont Clinic is committed to creating an inclusive environment where individuals from all backgrounds feel comfortable.
