The Role: The U.S. Press Officer will report directly to the Associate Director of U.S. Media Relations and will work closely with the Center’s attorneys and other U.S. Program staff.  At this critical time for reproductive rights, she/he/they will help shape the organization’s messaging and create proactive press strategies to influence public discourse and policy makers, effecting real change.  The Press Officer will play a critical role on the Press Team, securing coverage of the Center as well as its clients in high-profile media. The Press Officer will collaborate with the larger Communications Team to increase the visibility of the Center’s work in the U.S., including litigation and policy/advocacy work at the federal and state level. They will engage journalists and thought leaders at the national and local level to promote the Center’s work on priority issues like abortion access and maternal health care. This includes securing media coverage and interviews (TV, radio, online and print); placing op-eds in key media outlets; developing press materials and talking points; creating comprehensive press plans; and preparing spokespeople for media appearances. The Press Officer plays a strategic role in the Communications Department, continually surveying the media landscape for upcoming opportunities and challenges—and working with colleagues within and outside the department to develop strategies for responding to them, often on very tight deadlines. This position can be based out of the Center’s New York headquarters or Washington, D.C. office. Exceptional candidates in other locations will be considered. The Center is currently using a hybrid work model. Covid-19 Vaccination is required for all U.S.-based Center employees.
