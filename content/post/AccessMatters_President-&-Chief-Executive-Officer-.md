Under the overall direction of the Board of Directors, the President & CEO is the primary leader, strategist and external champion of AccessMatters’ mission. The President & CEO has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the vision and the aims of the organization’s core programming and services as well as its overarching values-based strategic plan are known and carried out successfully.  Responsibilities include organizational and team leadership, fundraising, and overall stewardship of the organization’s resources and assets. 


AccessMatters is looking for its next President and CEO to build on the organization’s 50+ years of working to ensure equitable access to sexual and reproductive health services in the Greater Philadelphia area and Pennsylvania. The next CEO should be a dynamic and visionary leader who embodies inclusive and trauma-informed leadership approaches, and demonstrates a deep commitment to anti-racist culture and leadership. 

The next CEO will focus  on external relationships, partnership building, building trust with communities served and making their voices central to the work, opportunity exploration, continue full staff community building; and support ongoing employee relations work.  Critically, the CEO will continue building the strength and cohesion of the Senior Leadership and Senior Management Teams, to foster multi-disciplinary strategic thinking about the organization’s future impact. 

AccessMatters has an operating budget of $15M with approximately 50 employees.
