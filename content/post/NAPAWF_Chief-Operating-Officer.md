Reporting to the Executive Director and serving as an integral member of the executive leadership team, the Chief Operating Officer will be responsible for the development of NAPAWF’s overall operational strategy.  The Chief Operating Officer is responsible for making sure all staff have everything they need to do their job well.  Along with the strategic components, the COO will be charged with introducing, developing, and implementing more sophisticated policies and procedures both in the finance and general operational realms. This is an outstanding opportunity for a senior level leader with a proven track record of creative problem-solving, building, and change management to join a fast-growing, mission-driven organization.
