Are you a feminist nurse practitioner? Would you like to be part of a client-centered health care model that allows longer visits with an emphasis on prevention and health education? Is providing care that is fat-positive, trauma-informed and guided by harm-reduction important to you? CWHC has taken part in radical client-centered care for the past 45 plus years. This position will include extensive training on providing trauma informed gynecology from a reproductive justice lens as well providing gender affirming hormone therapy using an informed consent model.
