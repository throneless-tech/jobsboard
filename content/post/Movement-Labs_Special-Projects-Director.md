Movement labs is hiring for the role of Special Projects Director for the 2024 cycle. This role is a mission critical position for our Political Innovation Incubator - it leads execution for any political innovation idea that involves outside-the-box, off-the-beaten-path experiments. 

This role will be responsible for moving dozens of ideas through the process of vetting, scoping, project planning and piloting them to assess if they have the potential to net over 1000 votes across the seven battleground states. If pilots are successful, work includes scaling those ideas up ahead of the 2024 election. This role will report to the VP of Political Innovation and will work closely with the Incubator Director. 

This role will oversee several pilot projects. Two examples: Work with a community organization on the ground in a battleground state to provide crucial resources to voters prior to the election. Or, work alongside an organization recruiting DJs to host parties at polling sites. Work with them to coordinate and execute the early vote and election day parties to success.

This role will be responsible for quickly testing the effectiveness and feasibility of such programs and then scaling up those that prove most effective.
