Scale for Change is seeking enthusiastic canvassers to serve as a part of Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic’s 2022 midterm election direct voter contact program. As a canvasser, you will travel door to door to encourage community members to vote in the midterm election. You will be responsible for having a certain number of conversations per day. You will not fundraise. If you’re fired up and ready to organize in your community, we urge you to apply!
