Electing Women Alliance (EWA) is a national network of local giving groups that bring women together as a community to support Democratic women candidates. The New Mexico Lead is a new position that will have responsibilities for managing a local Electing Women group focused on national US Senate and Governorâ€™s races while coordinating with in-state allies on fundraising for state legislative races in New Mexico. The New Mexico Lead will grow a community of women donors who want to help close the political gender giving gap at the national and state level.
