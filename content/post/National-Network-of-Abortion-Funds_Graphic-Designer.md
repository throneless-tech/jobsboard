The Graphic Designer is responsible for using design and creative thinking to help implement NNAF’s strategies for elevating the work of abortion funds and changing dominant cultural narratives about abortion. You’ll seek fresh, exciting ways to convey big ideas while staying true to the core of NNAF’s established brand. You’ll (hopefully!) also find the simple things oddly satisfying: setting type beautifully, making an info-dense chart so pretty it practically sings, building clean organized files that are easy to come back to months later. This position coordinates collaboratively with the Design and Branding Manager, the Communications department, and cross-departmentally to create graphics and layouts for social media, websites, emails, reports, direct mail, newsletters, and merchandise. With the support of our brand style guide, you will work with typography, photography, illustrative elements, and video assets to create striking, brand-aligned visuals to use for education, culture change, marketing, promotion, and the amplification of abortion funds.
