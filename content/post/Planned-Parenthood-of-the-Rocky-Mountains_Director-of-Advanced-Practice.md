Much of your work is done in collaboration with others either individually, in small groups, or in large group settings. You will form a dyad with the Director of Health Center Operations to develop and implement a strategic plan for our health care operation in collaboration with the Director of Clinical Quality and Risk Management. You will also lead a team of Advanced Practice Managers in the oversight of all advanced practice clinicians at the affiliate.  As a clinician leader, you will see a panel of patients in one or more health centers, with 20% of your time being spent in direct patient care.  There will also be times when you work solo to collect and analyze data, write reports and briefs, and prepare for presentations to clinicians, health center staff, and executive leadership.
