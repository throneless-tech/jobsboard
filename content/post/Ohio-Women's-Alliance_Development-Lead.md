Our strong financial position and commitment to building power through the leadership of women of color have led to the organization growing out of our Co-Executive Director model, and in the spring of 2023, Ohio Womenâ€™s Alliance will become a single Executive Director-led organization. OWA has been succession planning for over a year to make this exciting change, and the next phase of this process requires hiring a Development Lead to support our Executive Director in fundraising initiatives, strengthen our foundation fundraising, introduce major donors to our Executive Director and the incredible initiatives she leads, and build a fundraising plan to raise 150% of our budget.
