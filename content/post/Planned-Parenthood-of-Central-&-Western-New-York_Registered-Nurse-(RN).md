At Planned Parenthood we believe that diversity in identity and perspective enriches our agency and allows us to better serve our clients. We are committed to workforce diversity and aspire to reflect the communities we serve. To that end, we strongly encourage people of color, LGBTQ identifying individuals, people with disabilities and other underrepresented groups to apply. In support of our mission, the RN will provide direct clinical care offered through several programs from family planning to surgical services ensuring patients receive professional services in a timely manner. This position plans, directs and evaluates total nursing care for the treatment of all patients. The Registered Nurse also performs routine laboratory testing including blood draws.
