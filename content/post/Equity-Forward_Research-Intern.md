This isn’t your typical researcher role; as an Equity Forward intern, you’ll participate in meaningful work, advocating for reproductive rights, gaining experience in advocacy and research, and acquiring tools and knowledge to take with you in your future career. The ideal candidate will have experience in political research and a commitment to protecting reproductive rights. You will support Equity Forward’s research team in conducting public records research and producing reports. The position requires the ability to communicate complex information in a digestible manner, juggle multiple priorities, and an
attention to detail. We encourage candidates with diverse perspectives and experiences to apply.
