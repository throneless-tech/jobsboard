The Montana LR-131 opposition coalition is recruiting a campaign coordinator to lead the coordination of organizations and individuals working together to oppose LR-131. The campaign coordinator will work closely with the campaign manager and the steering committee to support campaign logistics and operations, including managing communications and organizing meetings with coalition members and external partners. The campaign coordinator will also serve as our coalition’s state lead of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center’s (BISC) pilot program for their Declaration of Equity and Accountability toolkit and process (DOE). The role of the campaign coordinator in this pilot program will be to facilitate our coalition’s integration of equitable and inclusive practices into the ballot initiative process (additional background information about this program is provided below). This individual will also receive direct coaching, guidance, and support from the BISC team to bolster and sustain capacity at the state-level for ongoing work on progressive issues. We view this campaign coordinator position as an investment in Montana and an opportunity to build longer-term grassroots power, capacity for integrating equity and accountability within progressive movements, and a stronger ballot infrastructure in our state.

This position will be housed at Montana Women Vote (MWV), a non-profit organization based in Missoula; MWV is committed to increasing participation in all aspects of democracy. While MWV will provide administrative and logistical support to the campaign coordinator, the position will report to and will work closely with the coalition’s steering committee throughout and immediately following the duration of the campaign.
