This Organizing program is Planned Parenthoodâ€™s national effort to work with the BIPOC community on fights for reproductive health, sex education, and access to care. Beginning in 2019, BIPOC  organizers have worked to build sustainable, community-organizing teams in partnership with the BIPOC community throughout Planned Parenthood affiliate organizations across the country.
