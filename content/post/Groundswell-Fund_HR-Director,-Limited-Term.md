At Groundswell, we recognize the crucial roles that values-aligned human resources and organizational infrastructure building play in supporting a healthy organizational ecology. Well-run human resources departments are vital toward achieving those efforts. The Human Resources (HR) Director will lead and manage all human resources functions for Groundswell and Groundswell Action Fund. Accountable for Groundswellâ€™s HR functions, the HR Director will serve as a key thought partner to the Interim Co-Executive Directors, Senior HR Manager, and senior management.
