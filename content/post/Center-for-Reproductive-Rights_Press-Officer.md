The Press Officer will report directly to the U.S. Press Officer and will work closely with the Center’s attorneys and other U.S. Program staff.  She/he/they will play a critical role on the team ensuring the continued presence of the Center for Reproductive Rights as well as its partners and clients in high-profile media, shaping the organization’s messaging and influencing public discourse on the issues we confront. A central and immediate focus of this work will be a major U.S. Supreme Court case that the Center will argue in fall 2021. The Press Officer will work closely with the rest of the Press Team to develop and execute innovative and proactive strategies for increasing the visibility of the Center’s litigation in the U.S., as well as state and federal policy/advocacy work.  They will engage journalists and thought leaders at the national, regional and local levels to promote the Center’s work and initiatives. This includes securing media coverage and interviews (TV, radio, online and print); placing op-eds in key media outlets; developing materials for media moments, events and campaigns; and preparing spokespeople for media appearances.
