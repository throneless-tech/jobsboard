The Gender Equity and Governance Program seeks a Program Officer (PO) to lead the U.S. Reproductive Equity strategy (USRE). As a member of the Gender Equity and Governance team, the PO manages The Hewlett Foundation’s work to support family planning services and advocacy to protect reproductive rights. With the support of a Grants Officer, the PO will manage a grant portfolio that includes $12M-$15M in grant funds, as well as resources for grantees that extend “beyond the grant dollars,” including access to donor collaboratives, grantee connections with other funders, and other forms of knowledge-sharing and influencing. 

The PO will also work with colleagues to identify opportunities for cross-strategy and cross-sector collaboration and learning. In addition, the PO will contribute to the overall culture of the organization and promote and put into practice the foundation’s values and practices of diversity, equity, and inclusion.  

Candidate Profile
Reproductive health, rights, and justice in the United States is at a crossroads. Currently, much of the foundation’s grantmaking in this area involves building strong institutions, strengthening the field, policy and advocacy, and grassroots community mobilization, with a smaller set of grants focused on service delivery. Looking forward, The Hewlett Foundation will seek to build on the learnings of this work to support policy change, reproductive health and rights service delivery, and movement and field-building. 

Recognizing the content expertise that comes from practitioners, The Hewlett Foundation seeks candidates who have direct experience in on-the-ground movement and/or field-building, program leadership, or service delivery. Knowledge of and experience developing and moving strategies that contribute to policy change in reproductive equity or other aligned areas will be valuable skill sets to manage this portfolio. Aligned areas could include any issue space that relate to identity-based movement work, such as marijuana legalization, LGBTQ+ rights, racial justice, women’s economic empowerment, and/or gun control. Experience with state-based work is an asset, but not a requirement. 

Prior experience in philanthropy is not a prerequisite. 

The foundation seeks a strategic thinker and resourceful self-starter who is passionate about promoting and improving reproductive health, rights, and justice in the U.S. They will be comfortable operating with broad strategic parameters and exploring opportunities that can lead to bold and unconventional approaches.
