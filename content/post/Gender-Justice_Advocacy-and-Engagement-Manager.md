The Advocacy and Engagement Manager will work hand-in-hand with the Advocacy Director to manage advocacy, education, and public engagement initiatives across projects, coalitions, and partnerships. Specifically, the Advocacy and Engagement Manager will lead our work with the Rights, Faith & Democracy Collaborative, a coalition (Gender Justice, Take Action MN, OutFront MN, and Jewish Community Action) working to develop collaborative strategies to counter efforts to use religion as a license to discriminate. This role also takes the lead on advocacy and education work supporting the rights of transgender youth and transgender athletes. A large part of this role will be working on managing, building, and deepening the organizationâ€™s coalition work and increasing our effectiveness at demonstrating public support for our initiatives.
