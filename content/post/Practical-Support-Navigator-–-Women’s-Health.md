The Health Care/Practical Support Navigator (“Navigator”) is a unique position and a new position for MCHA. The position is funded to support people trying to access abortion care who need help navigating the ever-changing abortion landscape. Because both California and Lo sAngeles are Safe Havens for abortion, the state has funded additional support in the form of
funding for services to assure safe access to care. The navigator will help with health coverage and care, but also provide the “practical”, monetary and other supports available to this population.
