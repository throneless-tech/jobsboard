As Volunteer & Engagement Coordinator, you will be an integral part of Colorado Doula Project’s service delivery, both in Colorado and nationwide. 

In less than a year, Colorado Doula Project has transitioned from an entirely volunteer-run organization to a small team of paid staff members, of which you will be the sixth member. You will report directly to the Executive and Deputy Directors, and will work closely with our Abortion Support Network (ASN) Manager and ASN Intake Team to oversee and support the entirety of our volunteer cohort. You will ensure that each of CDP’s volunteer pathways grows and is maintained in a healthy, organized way by maintaining existing systems and improving them when necessary. With an eye towards volunteer retention, you will maintain an active presence amongst our volunteer populations to ensure that everyone feels supported, has what they need to thrive, and carries out their volunteer responsibilities with excellence.
