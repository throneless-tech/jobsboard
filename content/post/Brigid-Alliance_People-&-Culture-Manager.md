The Brigid Alliance seeks to add a People & Culture Manager to help to create and shape the culture of a remotely staffed organization as it’s looking to sustain a period of significant growth beckoned by an increasing need for travel support among abortion seekers in the US. The People & Culture Manager will work closely to collaborate with and report to the Director of Operations.
