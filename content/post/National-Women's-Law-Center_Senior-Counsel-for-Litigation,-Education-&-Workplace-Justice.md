The Senior Counsel for Litigation will help lead and implement the team’s litigation strategy (including direct representation and amicus briefs) to proactively promote gender justice in schools and workplaces and to defend against threats to the civil rights and other legal protections enjoyed by workers and students. In addition to matters focused on workplace justice and education, the Senior Counsel will also work with the Legal Director on cross-cutting litigation matters, and assist in coordinating Center-wide litigation efforts. The National Women’s Law Center seeks to effect change through the courts by bringing our own litigation, filing amicus briefs in cases of particular importance to gender justice, and joining and collaborating with numerous partners to provide litigation guidance and expertise. The Senior Counsel will identify and forward NWLC litigation and amicus briefs in cases addressing education and workplace justice priorities. These include a strong focus on the rights of women and girls of color, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and others facing intersectional discrimination. Relevant matters may include Title VII and Title IX litigation and other litigation relating to sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination, unequal pay, disparate school discipline including dress codes, and other forms of sex discrimination, including discrimination against LGBTQIA+ individuals.  The work also is likely to include litigation addressing the scope of religious exemptions from key civil rights protections.
