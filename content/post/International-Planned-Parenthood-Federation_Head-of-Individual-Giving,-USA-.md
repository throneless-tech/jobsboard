IPPF is looking for an ambitious and proactive, experienced fundraiser who can help us deliver our bold plans and reach a target income of USD4 million/year towards our essential work. We are investing heavily to revamp our systems as well as in donor acquisition this year to grow our pool of donors who provide sustainable and regular financial support towards our mission of providing sexual and reproductive health and rights particularly in the hardest to reach, unstable and marginalized places in the world.
