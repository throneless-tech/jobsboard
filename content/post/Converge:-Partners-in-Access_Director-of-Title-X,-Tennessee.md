Converge: Partners in Access is dedicated to ensuring all people can access high quality reproductive and sexual healthcare when they need it, how they need it and where they live. In September 2023, Converge was awarded a $3.9M federal grant to expand its programs into Tennessee. In support of this expansion, we are seeking a Director of Title X, Tennessee to oversee the roll-out and ongoing oversight of our work in the region. Reporting to the Vice President of Programs, this position calls for a public health champion who is energized to grow a network of providers and partners and bring essential family planning healthcare to Tennessee residents.
