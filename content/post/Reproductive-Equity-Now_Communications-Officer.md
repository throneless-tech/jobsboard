Reproductive Equity Now (REN) seeks a full-time (40 hours per week) Communications Officer to help lead communications for our rapidly growing organization. This position is ideal for someone who has a passion for reproductive equity, a deep knowledge of communications and media relations, and a drive to professionally learn and grow. Reporting
to the Communications Director, and in close collaboration with the Digital Communications Officer, the Communications Officer will help expand Reproductive Equity Nowâ€™s footprint into New England and ensure the organization remains a regional thought leader for abortion access and reproductive equity issues. Since 1972, Reproductive Equity Now has led the way in advancing reproductive freedom in the Commonwealth. After recently rebranding our organization, we are on a path to regional expansion. Our mission is to make equitable access to the full spectrum of reproductive health
care a reality for all people regardless of their race, ethnicity, income, zip code, gender, age, immigration status, ability, sexual orientation, or religion. Advancing reproductive justice and eliminating barriers to safe, legal abortion care are central to our mission.
