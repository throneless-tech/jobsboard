We must conscientiously work to ensure that our education and research are targeted to address professional and education gaps in nursing. The Digital Outreach Assistant will play a vital role in documenting and contextualizing the nursing and SRH sector. This research will assist the organization to think strategically about how to develop programs and education that addresses the education gaps and address systemic barriers to accessing comprehensive healthcare.
