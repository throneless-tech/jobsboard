Registering a significant portion of the more than 2 million unregistered likely Democratic voters in Texas is one of the Texas Democratic Party’s top strategic priorities in 2022. The person in this role will be the primary driver and manager of the TDP’s voter registration efforts. The Deputy Political Director (Voter Registration) will be expected to work closely with other members of the political team and TDP leadership to develop and implement programming, lead our voter registration efforts, and maintain relationships with allies, elected officials, candidates, county parties, and supporters.
