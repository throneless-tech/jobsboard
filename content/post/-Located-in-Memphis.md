NSRH's Training in Abortion Care (TAC) Residency is a 6-month residency for registered nurses to gain hands-on clinical experience in abortion care. In addition to clinical training, nurses will also receive interprofessional programming to support their development as advocates for reproductive rights and justice. Participants will receive a $1,000 stipend. The program has clinical sites at CHOICES Memphis Center for Reproductive Health and Planned Parenthood Louisville -- we're still looking for applicants for the Memphis site. Apply today! Applications open through February 10th. Please reach out to anna@nsrh.org with any questions.
