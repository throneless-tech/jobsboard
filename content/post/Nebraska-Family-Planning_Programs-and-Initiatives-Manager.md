At Nebraska Family Planning, we work to provide access to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare services and education for Nebraskans statewide. We are a not-for-profit with fewer than 10 employees who manage a statewide initiative that braids both federal and private funding to advance our mission. NEFP is at an exciting time of growth and expansion. A collaborative team of subject matter experts works in an integrated and iterative fashion to implement, evolve, and expand programming and best practices in sexual and reproductive health.

As we expand our role in sexual and reproductive health in the state, we are seeking a mission-driven professional to join the Programs & Initiatives team. The Programs & Initiatives Manager is an integral member of the team which leads NEFPâ€™s program of work, including: training, initiatives, education and outreach, and working in partnership with funded organizations. This position reports to the Senior Director, Programs & Initiatives.

If you are a self-starter, committed to reproductive justice, experienced in building trust-based relationships, and able to switch between thinking big and implementing day-to-day operations this could be the opportunity for you. Candidates with a background in sexual and reproductive health, specifically sexual health education, are encouraged to apply.
