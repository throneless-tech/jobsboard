Working closely with the Board Chair and the Co-Executive Director- Programs & Digital Advocacy, the Co-Executive Director- Philanthropy & Development (COED) is accountable for helping to achieve the fundraising and new business development goals of the organization by growing our corporate, high net-worth donor pool and major gifts contributions, expanding our donor base, and by managing in person and virtual donor relationships and external engagements. The COED’s primary focus will be to set up short term face-to-face or virtual engagements to introduce the foundation and discuss regranting and intermediary partnerships with larger foundations and donor collaboratives that focus on our key areas of Birth & Reproductive Justice, Children, Girls, LGBTQ+, Racial Justice, Family Equity, Crisis & Rapid Response, and Gender Based Violence. You will work closely with GFG’s current leadership for leads, introductions, and direction, as well as being expected to cultivate your own meetings using your pre-existing and new contacts. This is a PT consultant role.
