Reporting to the Associate Director of Individual Giving and working closely with the Executive Director, the Major Gifts Manager (MGM) is responsible for managing and growing MADREâ€™s Major Donor program and working collaboratively with the Development and Communications, Marketing and Information Systems teams to create and implement strategies that result in greater individual giving at the major giving level. The MGM will primarily work to secure annual gifts of $1,000+ and multi-year gifts from individual donors and prospects to bolster our fundraising efforts. This includes identifying, qualifying, cultivating, soliciting, and stewarding their own portfolio of donors and prospects, implementing targeted strategies they develop. 

The MGM is skillful in building and managing relationships with a wide range of individuals, including major donors, prospects, and colleagues. The individual should be charismatic, creative, organized, and goal oriented; exhibit a high level of professionalism and maturity; display superb written and oral communication skills, including a track record of managing a portfolio of donors at the $1K+ level; demonstrate immaculate attention to detail; and be able to multitask and meet deadlines. A strong background or interest in human rights is essential.
