On August 19th and 20th, the Amplify Georgia Collaborative will hold a virtual organizing summit that brings together supporters and bases of our partners and allies — to build relationships, get political education and skills training, and activate around civic engagement in the fall — united in a vision of expanding reproductive justice (RJ) and abortion access in Georgia. 

We are seeking an event planner/coordinator for the summit, hopefully beginning in June and working through the end of August.
