The Sex Education Collaborative (SEC) is issuing this Request for Proposals for experienced consultants and/or consulting firms to facilitate and create an intentional container for SEC members across different lived experiences to engage in respectful dialogue that moves individual organizations and the collective into a future of repair and wholeness. The consultant will coordinate with and report to the SECâ€™s Racial Justice and Equity Task Team (RJETT). The project proposes to create an SEC discussion and learning space, assess the organizational assessment data gathered from SEC member organizations, and support the RJETT in developing resources and supports for SEC members to use in their individual journeys towards becoming a more racially just and equitable organization as well as the full SEC in becoming a more racially just and equitable collaborative.
