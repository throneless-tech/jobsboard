Firelands seeks an Organizing Director who will bring experience, strategic analysis, and a deep commitment to relationship-building to elevate our work to the next level. The Organizing Director role is primarily about working with people one-on-one and in teams to develop organizers and leaders: cultivating their day-to-day skills and political analysis and designing and maintaining systems so that staff and members can achieve strategic goals. This position requires a strong belief in the power, abilities, and intelligence of working-class people, an understanding of the racial inequities and political contradictions within the working class, and a commitment to uniting working-class people across race and political orientation around a shared strategy to win. The ideal candidate will have particular excitement and experience working with an organizing team and member-leader team largely comprised of Latina women from Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Organizing with immigrants and working in Spanish and English are important skills for this position.
