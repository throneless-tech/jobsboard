The Century Foundation (TCF)—a think tank promoting progressive ideas and innovative practical solutions that advance opportunity and equality—seeks a part-time (up to twenty hours per week) health care policy intern, with a focus on Black maternal health, to be based in TCF’s Washington, D.C. office. This internship will also have the option for virtual/remote work for those outside of the D.C. metro area. The health care policy internship is a paid position (starting at $15 per hour) and will run from September 13, 2021 to December 17, 2021. Academic credits may be available for this internship. The part-time health care policy intern is responsible for supporting research needs related to Black maternal health for TCF’s health care fellows. This is a special internship opportunity geared toward undergraduate and graduate students matriculating at the nation’s historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs).
