The Constellations Grantmaking Strategist will lead in the design and implementation of the participatory and trust-based grantmaking function for Constellations. They will develop a streamlined process to redistribute flexible and unrestricted funds to the field in the form of general operations grants to cultural and narrative strategy organizations, individual awards to artist disruptors and culture bearers, and network weaving and learning grants. They will work closely with the Advisory Board tasked to nominate and make grant recommendations, and hold key relationships with JustFund, our operational grantmaking platform and Amalgamated Foundation, our fiscal sponsor.
