The National Employment Law Project (NELP) seeks a dynamic and skilled person to join our Work Structures team as a Senior Staff Attorney. You will join a team of experts who are working with partners to (1) combat anti-worker corporate labor contracting practices, such as the misuse of temporary help and staffing agencies and the misclassification of employees as independent contractors; and (2) devise and advance pro-worker policies that ensure employer accountability, expand workersâ€™ access to rights, and build worker power and fundamental rights.
