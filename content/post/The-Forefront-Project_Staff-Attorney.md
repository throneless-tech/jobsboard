The Forefront Project is providing essential legal advice and representation to a large and growing number of reproductive rights, health, and justice organizations engaged in hard-hitting advocacy across the country. Among other things, we help organizations craft effective and compliant advocacy campaigns, communications, and events; track and report lobbying and ballot measure activity under laws that require it; and engage in impactful nonpartisan election-related activity. To meet the needs of the movement right now, we need to add a staff attorney.
