Converge: Partners in Access is dedicated to ensuring all people can access high-quality reproductive and sexual health care services when they need it, how they need it, and where they live. As the Mississippi and Tennessee grantee of Title X – the only federal Family Planning Program – we collaborate with each state's public health agency, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and community partners to build a healthcare system that places people at the center of reproductive and sexual health care.  At a time of organizational growth and an increasing need for Converge’s services now more than ever, the Vice President of Marketing & Communications will provide leadership over all aspects of marketing and communications – inclusive of brand management, content creation, audience development, campaigns, and external relations – working collaboratively across the organization to elevate Converge’s presence regionally and nationally.
