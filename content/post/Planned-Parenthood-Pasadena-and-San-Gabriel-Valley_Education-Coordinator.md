The Education Coordinator will support the Education Department in tracking progress towards goals through data management, evaluation coordination, and administrative support.

This is a two-year, grant funded remote role with no assigned administrative office workspace (hybrid access is pending). Applicants must be based in California and have reliable home Wi-Fi access.
