he battle for Democracy is urgent. To defeat the Right, the Left must unite at the voting booth. This November it is critical that we mobilize every Democratic voter we can to stave off an increasingly radical Republican Party at the polls. We are currently seeking Lead Field Directors to help get voters to the polls in critical battleground communities for the 2022 midterm elections. Increasing voter turnout is one of the keys to Democrats winning in November, and we must win if Democrats are going to be able to address systemic issues impacting the most vulnerable communities in our country. Lead Directors will recruit, train, and manage a team of local canvassers and deputy directors. Please note this is a temporary position that will run through the November election.
