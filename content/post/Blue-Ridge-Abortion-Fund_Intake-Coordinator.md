The Blue Ridge Abortion Fund supports autonomy in reproductive decision making by providing financial, logistical, and emotional support to people from, or traveling to, Virginia seeking abortion services. By giving grants to people to fill the gap between what financial resources they have and the full cost of their abortion, we uphold abortion as a community good. Funding abortion is an act of radical care that affirms our belief that all community members should have the agency and the resources to make their own decisions about their bodies. Reporting to the Executive Director, the Intake Coordinator(s) serves as frontline support to callers seeking financial support for their abortions and is responsible for providing supportive, compassionate assistance to people seeking an abortion. The ideal candidate will be deeply committed to the abortion funding and reproductive rights movement and be a flexible self-starter who is willing to tackle new projects and take on additional work, as necessitated by the evolving needs of our callers and team.
