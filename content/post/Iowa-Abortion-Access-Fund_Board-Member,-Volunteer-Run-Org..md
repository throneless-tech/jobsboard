Iowa Abortion Access Fund is committed to providing financial assistance and access to abortion services for people in Iowa, including the Quad Cities area, who lack the resources to pay for an abortion. IAAFâ€™s Board of Directors are a team of volunteers that support the ongoing and important work of the organization. We are dedicated to the belief that the freedom to choose legal abortion should be available to all individuals. We're currently looking to add 4+ people to our team to fill a variety of roles including website manager, co-treasurer, social media manager, and volunteer coordinator.
