Unchained At Last is a survivor-led nonprofit organization dedicated to ending forced and child marriage in the United States through direct services and systems change. The Advocacy Manager is a great role for someone with three to five years of experience doing direct lobbying for a social justice organization or campaign. The ideal candidate is equal parts passionate and detail-oriented. One day this person will be working with leaders across the country to testify at hearings and organize chain-ins, the next they will be prepping a legislator to introduce a bill in a state legislature.  In this role, you will be responsible for managing state and local coalitions, identifying legislative champions in key states, and keeping impeccable track of all of our work. The salary for this position is $82,000. The job is remote within commuting distance of northern New Jersey.
