MSF-USA is seeking a Policy and Advocacy Intern, who will support the Global Health Advocacy and Policy (GHAP) Team on various projects. The Policy and Advocacy Intern should be prepared to help with research projects (some ad hoc and short-term, some more in-depth), legislative and events monitoring, admin support, including contact database management and meeting coordination. Legislative and events monitoring and research will focus on global health topics covered by the GHAP Team dossiers, which include: access to medicines, antimicrobial resistance, global health governance and financing, sexual and reproductive health, and climate and environmental health. The intern will also assist with materials development and meeting preparation, such as drafting briefing documents and copyediting. Current or recent graduate-level students or law students pursuing work in a field related to the GHAP Team’s work, including public policy, law, global health, public health, or international relations, would best suit this position. The term for this position would be Spring 2024 from January – May.
