Through Our Folks: Voices of LGBTQ+ Youth of Color, young spokespeople and storytellers will have the opportunity to gain skills in giving media interviews, writing for a variety of blogs and media outlets, creating engaging digital content, and using social media to amplify their work. The cohort will begin with training later this fall, and participants will be expected to produce 8 pieces of content (4 written, 4 digital) and participate in 4 speaking engagements by the end of the program. From October 2022 â€“ April 2023, participants will be provided with a stipend of $250 per month to support their efforts.
