Provide is seeking an Executive and Program Assistant (EAPA) to increase our team’s capacity to support frontline healthcare and social service providers in responding to their clients' needs around abortion and other stigmatized care. 

We are looking for someone with exceptional administrative and executive support skills. This person should also be a skillful verbal and written communicator who demonstrates self-awareness, emotional maturity, and good judgment in a diversity of situations, particularly in maintaining a realistic balance among multiple priorities. The EAPA should be an effective and resourceful problem-solver who delights in collaboration and demonstrates a sky-high level of initiative. You seek out opportunities to use your skills to help your team achieve shared goals.   Our ideal candidate is energized by the key themes of our work, (i.e. access to reproductive and sexual healthcare, reproductive justice) and has a strong analysis of how the intersections of systemic oppression (white supremacy, racism, sexism, ableism, classism, transphobia, etc.) negatively impact access to abortion and other stigmatized healthcare.    

This position is a full-time (40 hr/week) remote work position based in the US.The EAPA reports directly to the Managing Director (MD). The EAPA serves as an executive assistant to the MD and will be responsible for providing administrative support related to the delivery, evaluation, and marketing of Provide’s programs.  Limited travel up to 35% will be required for this position.
