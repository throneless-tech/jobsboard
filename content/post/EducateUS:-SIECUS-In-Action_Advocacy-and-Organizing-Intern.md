EducateUS: SIECUS In Action is building a movement of voters laser-focused on advancing progressive sex education policy and implementation across the country. As we are a new and growing organization, this is a great opportunity for an intern who wants to see how many facets of an advocacy organization work. The intern will assist the Executive Director in a variety of key organizational activities, including but not limited to supporting our local organizing partners, vetting potential school board candidates for endorsement, opposition tracking, communicating with voters, and more.
