As the Development and Outreach Manager, you will be an invaluable presence in your mission to help Colorado Doula Project meet our fundraising goals through fundraising initiatives, major gift solicitation, in-person and virtual events, grant research and application, and increasing name recognition of CDP on a local and national scale. 

In less than a year, Colorado Doula Project has transitioned from an entirely volunteer-run organization to a small team of paid staff members, of which you will be the fourth member. You will report directly to the Executive and Deputy Directors, and will work closely with our Community Manager and a handful of dedicated volunteers selected from our larger cohort who support in our administrative function. In order to meet the increased need of abortion travelers to Colorado, we are in the midst of ambitious plans to ‘scale up,’ and this role comes with opportunities for growth and expansion of scope. 

CDP’s Development and Outreach Manager would be ideal for someone who finds it especially gratifying to dream about ‘what could be’ and has the follow-through to see it come to fruition. The newness of this role provides an opportunity for you–with the support and collaboration of the CDP team–to implement your own vision for sustainable fundraising infrastructure on an organizational scale.
