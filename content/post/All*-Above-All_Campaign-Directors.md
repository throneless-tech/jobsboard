All* Above All now seeks to engage two Campaign Directors to lead federal, state, and local advocacy, culture change efforts, network development and other strategies that advance abortion access at the intersection of economic, immigrant, and racial justice. One Campaign Director will focus on medication abortion and abortion coverage campaigns, and one will focus on immigrant justice and network partnerships. The Campaign Directors will develop and implement emerging growth strategies in close coordination with each other, All* Above Allâ€™s Co-Presidents, federal, state, and communications strategies teams, and other staff, consultants, and network partners. The Campaign Directors will each supervise one to two staff members and will report to the Co-Presidents.
