The Information + Knowledge Management Specialist (IKMS) will help harness the many sources of data flowing into CGRE and GEAF, and analyze and transform that data into narrative and visual stories that strengthen our ability to support the work of our funders, grantees, and other partners. The IKMS will bring experience building out systems and workflows that capture and bring order to large volumes of qualitative and quantitative data. They will be equally comfortable working with technical systems and helping to develop effective communications. They will be skilled in handling information gaps and managing ambiguity with an orientation toward practical uses of
data. This new, fully-remote role will report to the Grants + Data Manager and work across both CGRE and GEAF, especially with the Grants + Data and Philanthropy + Communications teams.
