Year-long fellowship (beginning Sept. 2021) that will bring together 10 community leaders from across our affiliate (NC, SC, WV, and VA) and provide them with access to the tools and resources they need to create their own vision of social justice through a community organizing project. This fellowship will operate under a reproductive justice framework, which will allow our fellows to work within the guidelines of their chosen track (five tracks total) to center the needs of the people most impacted by the issue that their project centers around. Only open to BIPOC.
