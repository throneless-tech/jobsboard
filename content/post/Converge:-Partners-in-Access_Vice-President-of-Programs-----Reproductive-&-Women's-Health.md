Founded in 2018, Converge: Partners in Access is dedicated to ensuring all people can access high quality reproductive and sexual health care services when they need it, how they need it and where they live. As the Mississippi grantee of Title X – the only federal Family Planning Program – we collaborate with the state's public health agency, health care providers, insurance companies, and community partners to build a health care system that places people at the center of reproductive and sexual health care. At a time of exciting growth, the Vice President (VP) of Programs will provide leadership for all program areas, sit on the senior management team, supervise four Director-level staff, and contribute to the overall strategic direction of the organization
