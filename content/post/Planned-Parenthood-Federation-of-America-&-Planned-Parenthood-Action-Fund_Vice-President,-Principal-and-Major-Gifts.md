The Vice President (VP), Principal and Major Gifts (PMG) leads the work of the PMG team to raise the necessary revenue to execute the strategic priorities of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), Planned Parenthood Action Fund (PPAF), Planned Parenthood Votes (PPVotes), and the Planned Parenthood Federal PAC (PPFedPAC). The PMG portfolio is composed of high-net-worth individual donors and families capable of making gifts of $25,000 or more with an emphasis on relationship building to grow gifts and pledges to six, seven, and eight-figure gifts. As a member of the Senior Development Leadership Team (SDLT), the VP, PMG has a deep personal commitment to, and understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and uses that as a frame to lead PMG and influence the direction of the division overall.

This position interacts with internal and external leaders and must have exceptional leadership and influencing skills. The PMG team includes more than 30 staff members organized among a frontline fundraising team, a political fundraising team, and an operations team. Other constituents include PMG donors and prospects; PPFA/PPAF senior leaders; Planned Parenthood affiliate CEOs and CDOs; and PPFA, PPAF, and affiliate board members.
