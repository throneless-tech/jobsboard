Reporting to the Senior Manager of Policy and Communications, the Public Health Writing Specialist will develop high-quality written content for stakeholders, including members, policymakers, and the public. Working with other USBC staff, member organizations, and coalitions, the specialist coordinates the planning and development of strategic communication and promotion materials to foster understanding of the role of human milk feeding in public health, advance equity in the lactation field, and support communication and comprehension of academic and research findings to the public.

USBC can only accept applications from residents of CA, IL, MD, MA, or OR, where employer registration is already established. All positions at USBC are remote, though semi-annual travel to events is expected to resume when conditions allow.
