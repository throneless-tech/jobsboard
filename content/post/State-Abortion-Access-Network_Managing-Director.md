The Managing Director is one of two inaugural staff positions and will be responsible for leading SAAN, providing both strategic oversight and hands-on support to advance our mission. This is an exciting opportunity to build SAAN’s infrastructure from the ground up. Over time, the vision is to establish a robust support services intermediary to fuel a state abortion advocacy movement. 
The ideal candidate is a collaborative servant leader with experience in the day-to-day realities of running small advocacy nonprofits and has a passion for creating supportive systems and structures that help people thrive. Working collaboratively with SAAN’s steering committee, members, and funders, you will execute on SAAN’s member-developed strategic priorities. You will manage an initial staff team of one (Major Gifts and Grants Officer), lead special projects, and drive the organization's growth and impact in the reproductive freedom movement.
