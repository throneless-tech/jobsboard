AFO is seeking candidates for a Legal Access Fellowship who is dedicated to serving Ohioans most impacted by reproductive oppression and criminalization. The Legal Access Fellow will help launch and coordinate the Legal Access Program at AFO which seeks to manage the drastic increase in need for short term legal advice and referral to pro-bono counsel following the SCOTUS decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, imposition of the Six Week Ban, and the increasing criminalization of reproductive healthcare in Ohio. We need someone who is passionate about reproductive justice, abolition, and direct legal service and can assist the Interim Executive Director and Legal Director in launching and managing the direct legal service and legal referral program at AFO.
