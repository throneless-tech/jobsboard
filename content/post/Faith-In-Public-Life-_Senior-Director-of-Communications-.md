Approach to the Job
Strategist’s mind: You quickly grasp the subtleties of complex issues and identify patterns in challenges. You don’t stop at diagnosing problems, though; you come up with insightful, pragmatic, equitable, and sustainable ways to produce positive change.
Inclusive leadership: You approach leadership with a mindset of “power with” rather than “power over.” You recognize the value of divergent perspectives and regularly include others in planning and decision-making. You build equity and inclusion into goals and plans for staff development, retention, strategy, and culture. As the lead on the communications strategy for the organization, you will sometimes make difficult decisions in the best interest of the organization. When needed, you’re able to weigh complex factors and communicate tough decisions with clarity and empathy.
Coaching and modeling: You make it your mission to develop others. You delegate skillfully and take the time to offer useful and actionable feedback. Because you lead by example (with our values as your north star), you inspire and motivate others to take action and meet goals. You hold the team accountable in ways that grow the people and our impact, and you make sure people feel appreciated.
Adaptability and problem solving: You are always ready to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and address obstacles. You look for the root of both simple and complex problems, so you can seek solutions. You approach work with a spirit of “yes” and adapt as things change, which they often do.
Ownership and resilience: You care deeply about getting results. You gather information, seek input, and drive work forward to the finish line. You think 3 (or 30) steps ahead to develop solutions, anticipate problems, and course-correct when needed. You hold a high bar even when things are hectic and bounce back from setbacks by turning each hurdle into a learning opportunity.
