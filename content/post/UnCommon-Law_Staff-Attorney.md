Staff Attorneys at UnCommon Law are responsible for the provision of legal services to clients and participants across a range of representation modalities, including direct representation in parole hearings; consultation management and delivery; habeas and other litigation; and legal services offered through Home After Harm and related in-prison workshops. Staff Attorney time allocation across these areas of representation varies greatly depending on role and team. This position will maintain a small caseload of parole hearing representation clients; however, the primary responsibilities of this position will be acting as the lead on providing limited scope legal services to program participants and facilitating legal workshops about the discretionary parole process. This role will support the Home After Harm team in improving, implementing and delivering workshops in both HAH institutions (CSP-LAC and Salinas Valley State Prison) and other prisons across the state.
