The Donor Relations Director (DRD) is a new position, previously combined with communications as a joint role. The DRD will work closely with the Chief Development Officer, Director of Funder Organizing, and the Communications Director to raise an annual budget of $28 million for both Groundswell’s 501c3 and 501c4. The DRD is specifically responsible for creating and implementing a strategy for sustained and increased revenue from individual donors, focusing on improving retention, enhancing communication, and deepening relationships. This position will also directly oversee a portfolio of donors making $100k or more gifts. The DRD reports to the Chief Development Officer and supervises the Donor Relations Manager and Donor Relations Assistant. 

The ideal candidate for this role is a dynamic, highly motivated leader with strong managerial skills and a background in philanthropy. They value building personal relationships with donors and understand the importance of high retention and conversion rates among supporters. The future DRD will also be a strategic thinker who excels at crafting plans to achieve organizational goals and creating accountability systems for tracking progress. To thrive in this position, the person we hire must be passionate about grassroots organizing for reproductive and social justice and eager to think creatively about how to find new, sustainable resources to fund work led by women of color.
