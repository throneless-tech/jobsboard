The Voice Your Vote! Voter Engagement Canvasser is a critical member of the Voice Your Vote! team, and is responsible for implementing our voter engagement programming across Pennsylvania and Ohio. The goal is to build power among Black women, femmes, girls and gender-expansive people who are either unregistered or infrequent voters. The Voice Your Vote! Community Outreach Coordinator is key in connecting this voter base to the local and the national Reproductive Justice movement.  The Voice Your Vote! Voter Engagement Canvasser will assist in mobilizing Black people of all genders and backgrounds, build organizational visibility, and will be dedicated to the health and well-being of those we serve throughout our three core cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland.
