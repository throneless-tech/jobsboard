DCAF seeks two (2) Caller Service and Engagement Co-Directors who will be among DCAF’s first full-time staff members. These leaders will both oversee core operations of DCAF’s services to callers seeking abortions and, in partnership with other DCAF staff, board members, and volunteers, lead the transformation of DCAF’s vision and alignment with our aspirational reproductive justice values. The Co-Directors will develop, implement, and monitor the full caller lifecycle and cultivate reflective processes and measures that center the communities DCAF serves.
