The ACLU seeks applicants for the full-time position of Campaign Strategist in the National Political Advocacy Department, based in the ACLU’s National offices in either Washington, D.C. or New York City.

The National Political Advocacy Department (NPAD) works to strengthen the efforts of the ACLU at the federal, state, and local levels of government. The department harnesses the political power that comes from having more than eleven million members and supporters, as well as affiliates in every state. Through issue campaigns buttressed by grassroots organizing, direct lobbying, leveraging earned and paid media and other modern tactics, the ACLU seeks to achieve significant policy and political change in the legislative, administrative and electoral arenas.

Reporting to the Deputy Director of the Liberty Division, the Campaign Strategist will work with national staff and ACLU affiliates to design, build, and execute campaigns directed at advancing civil liberties and civil rights by reaching specific political/policy outcomes. The Campaign Strategist will help drive programmatic work related to reproductive freedom and gender and economic justice. In the near term, the Campaign Strategist will play a key role in helping to define and implement a proactive programming agenda to match current challenges in the federal courts, including the Supreme Court’s looming decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.
