We are seeking a Communications Manager to join our team and support the company’s marketing and communications goals. An exceptional writer with excellent project management skills, the manager will support the development of internal and external communications, assist in managing media relations and strategic partnerships, as well as provide event production support and oversee the day-to-day organization and coordination of the department’s administrative operations.

The Communications Manager will work closely with the Vice-President and the entire Development, Marketing and Communications team (including external partners) to deliver quality communications deliverables to key stakeholders with considerable autonomy at times. The ideal candidate will have experience developing and executing strategic communications plans, drafting press releases, writing copy/content for company newsletters or memos aimed at diverse audiences (donors, press, partner orgs, etc.), publishing content to social media platforms and company websites, as well as creating marketing/promotional materials, and coordinating events.
Our team’s work is fast-paced and we manage multiple projects for both internal clients and external partners that often have tight deadlines and require considerable time, project, and people management skills.
