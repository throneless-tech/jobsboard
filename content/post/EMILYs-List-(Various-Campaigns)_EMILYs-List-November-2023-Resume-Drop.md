Are you coming off a 2023 campaign? Are you looking to start on your first? Do you have friends who are looking for their next job in campaigns?
Come and meet EMILYs List staff for brief informal conversations to discuss your background and the races you are interested in working on this cycle. 
Participants must be willing to go on a campaign for the 2024 cycle. Jobs are NOT located in DC.
