LCV is hiring a Data & Evaluation Director serving the Community and Civic Engagement (CCE) department, as well as the state LCV affiliates, who will, where permitted by law, utilize data in the voter file to determine which voters and members of the general public are likely to be engaged on environmental issues, and maintain voter file information that permits the organization to educate the public and motivate supporters to become active civic participants. Reporting to the Vice President of Civic Engagement, the Data & Evaluation Director will oversee data and targeting-related activities on voter registration, civic engagement, voter mobilization and community organizing for the CCE department and our flagship programs: Democracy for All (DFA) and Chispa.
