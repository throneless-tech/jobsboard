Elephant Circle, founded in 2009, has grown significantly in the last two years. Building on a strong foundation, we are leaning into continued expansion with the help of a Director of Resource Management and Operations who has business growth and resource management experience. This is a new position at Elephant Circle, offering a creative space to innovate and design this and other roles on the team. Candidates who are entrepreneurial, creative, business-minded and flexible are desired to help shape this position and define Elephant Circle’s trajectory in its next phase of growth. For example, don’t like the flat salary rate? Help us create something equitable and even better. We are looking for a business analyst who can enhance our social justice work. We need someone who can link our three orbits (Movement Building, Public Health Law and Advocacy, and Community Power) to strategic and operational business plans, and oversee the implementation of those plans and associated systems. Someone who has a love of spreadsheets, profit and loss reports, and cash flow dashboards is necessary, and especially welcome if their love is contagious.
