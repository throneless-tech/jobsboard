A role requiring enthusiasm and relationship-building, the Pro-Choice Ohio Central and Southern Ohio Field Organizer cultivates Pro-Choice Ohio’s community base throughout Central and Southern Ohio. The overall goal is to recruit and train volunteers, organize communities to build political power at the state and local levels, educate Ohioans on the importance of busting abortion-stigma, and ultimately contribute to increasing reproductive healthcare access – particularly abortion - in Ohio.
