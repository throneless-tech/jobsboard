 The Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund and Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (PPAF/PPLM) seeks an organizer based in Worcester MA. We are looking for a dynamic, fired up individual with organizing or community based experience who cares about equitable access to reproductive care and comprehensive sex education and believes in empowering and building community. The Raiz Organizer is responsible for growing a base of Latino/a/x supporters to build power for the broader reproductive health movement in Worcester’s Latino/a/x community. They will develop relationships with PPAF supporters and community organizations and ensure that consistent engagement opportunities exist for supporters and volunteer leaders in the region to feel empowered to take collective action in support of Planned Parenthood’s advocacy, electoral, and reproductive health work. This work includes organizing around electoral and issue-based campaigns, volunteer leadership development, youth organizing, and supporting regional execution of statewide constituency organizing programs. This role will also be instrumental in the PPLM/PPAF strategic plan’s focus on decreasing stigma and improving access to sexual and reproductive health care and education for Latino/a/x or Hispanic teens and teen parents in Worcester. Specifically, the Raiz organizer will play an active role in spearheading and executing a local community campaign for comprehensive sex education within the Worcester Public Schools.
