The Director of Communications’ primary role is to strategize and execute the Run for Something network’s communications efforts, which includes earned media, organic social media, and paid advertising across the different entities. The RFS communications department works to lift up and maintain the organization’s brand and awareness, recruit young leaders to consider running for office, amplify the work of RFS PAC-endorsed candidates and alumni, and support all external-facing efforts of the RFS team broadly. In addition, this position supervises two staff members and manages an external vendor. As a member of the RFS Leadership Team, this position must also contribute, integrate, and hold themselves and their department accountable to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) goals that Run for Something has established, and actively contribute towards the creation of a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture.
