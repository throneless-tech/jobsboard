North Carolina’s sweeping abortion ban and restrictions on reproductive health care are harming real people. Bans on any health care put politics above people and put our futures on the line. We’re working to ensure that everyone can live, thrive, and raise families in healthy communities. We’re fighting to stop this government intrusion and put the power back in the hands of the people. Field Directors will recruit, train, and manage a team of local canvassers to talk to voters about voting in the November election. Additionally, the Lead Campaign Director will manage a team of three or more Deputy Directors, and will be responsible for building an office to scale from the ground up. This position reports to the Project Director.
