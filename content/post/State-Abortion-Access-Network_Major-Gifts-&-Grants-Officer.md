The Major Gifts & Grants Officer is one of two inaugural staff positions for the State Abortion Access Network (SAAN). In this fund development role, you will serve as the lead subject-matter expert. The Major Gifts & Grants Officer will report to and be supported by the Managing Director, with the additional support of the SAAN steering committee in active fundraising efforts. This is an exciting opportunity to expand on SAAN’s early fundraising success and build a major gifts and grants program that will fund SAAN’s growth into a robust support services intermediary to fuel a state abortion advocacy movement. Applications will be accepted on a rolling basis, with a priority deadline of December 15th, 2023.
