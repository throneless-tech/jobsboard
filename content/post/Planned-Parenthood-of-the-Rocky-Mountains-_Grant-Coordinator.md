DEVELOPMENT TEAM OBJECTIVE:
As the Grant Coordinator, you will support PPRM’s Development program which raises gifts from individuals, foundations, companies, associations, government, and other sources. 

THE OBJECTIVE:
Your role will support the Organizational Giving Team, focusing on coordinating the grant process from proposal writing, administration, prospecting, stewardship, data collection and tracking, all the way to reporting to foundations, corporations, associations, and government funders.

SUCCESS:
You will know you are successful when the grants you work to secure and administer help to build a strong financial base for PPRM’s future. 

SNAPSHOT:
Your days will be filled with documenting the details of grants, reading requests for proposals, writing grant applications/reports, entering grant information into the database, working with stakeholders to meet grant requirements, preparing grant attachments, processing grant agreements, and creating grant budgets.
You will also work with other members of the Development team to contribute to stewardship, file organization, content generation/tracking, and storytelling efforts.
You may attend meetings and events before and after business hours and may work some evenings and weekends, depending on grant deadlines.
You will travel throughout our affiliate region occasionally and you may work a flexible schedule.
