You will be based in the Washington, DC location as a member of our Government Affairs team, reporting to the team’s Director. You will work with NELP’s staff of lawyers, policy experts, researchers, and strategic communications experts to advance our civil rights priorities. This is a non-supervisory role. The primary responsibility is for the civil rights portfolio. Issues you will cover will include, but not be limited to: occupational segregation, “fair chance” employment for people with arrest and conviction records, immigrant workers’ rights, and relevant issues before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and other agencies.
