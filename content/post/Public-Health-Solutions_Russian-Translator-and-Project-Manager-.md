With an annual budget of $1.6 billion and more than 6,000 employees throughout the five boroughs, the New York  City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) is one of the largest public health agencies in the world, serving 8 million New Yorkers from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds. We're tackling a broad range of public health issues with innovative policies and programs and getting exceptional results, but our work is never finished. The breadth of our innovative programs provides the widest range of choices for every member of our team.  

Since January 2020, DOHMH has been fighting the COVID-19 pandemic- activities include but are not limited to: surveillance & epidemiological investigations; lab testing; engaging and providing guidance to healthcare partners; ensuring the safety & health of responders; providing timely and accurate information to the public; promoting the emotional health of New Yorkers and coordinating citywide COVID-19 vaccine administration. With grant funds from  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), DOHMH is undertaking a new initiative to establish, expand, train, and sustain the public health workforce to support jurisdictional COVID-19 prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery initiatives over 2 years.

The selected candidate will be an employee of Public Health Solutions, a nonprofit organization which is the fiscal and administrative manager of the grant but work will  be supervised by DOHMH.  This is a grant-funded position ending June 30, 2023.
