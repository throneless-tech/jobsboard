Earlier this year, Whitman-Walker Institute (WWI) received a $750,000 investment from the Greater Washington Community Foundationâ€™s Health Equity Fund, designed to address the social and structural determinants of health and achieve health equity for DC residents. WWI recognizes the invaluable expertise and contributions of many organizations and advocates in addressing health equity in the District and will co-lead this work with a variety of partners throughout the four-year period. We are currently recruiting partners for Year 1 of Phase 1 of the project, which focuses on the development of a partnership framework that will culminate in the creation of a Queer and Trans Agenda for Racial and Economic Justice. WWI is seeking a consultant to manage the activities and contribute to 
the vision of this project in Years 1 and 2, with the potential to extend into Years 3 and 4. Consultant responsibilities include outreach and engagement, research and data collection, reporting and documentation, collaboration and teamwork and timeline and deliverables.
