The Senior Campaign Strategist will wear many hats, including strategic campaign planner, lobbyist around federal guidelines, coalition builder with an array of partners, liaison to technical assistance providers, and more.
The primary function of the Senior Strategist is to lead our Build Back Better - from Rescue to Recovery - engagement work with member groups across the country as federal funds flow to states & localities. In doing so, the Senior Strategist will work with member groups doing a combination of Equitable Implementation, Participatory Engagement, Co-governance, and Campaigning. Some are working on American Rescue Plan (ARP) programs, some on fighting for where loose funds get dedicated, and some on thinking about positioning for massive influxes of physical and human infrastructure funds.
