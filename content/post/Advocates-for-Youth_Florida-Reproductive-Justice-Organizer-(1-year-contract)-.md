Young people’s bodily autonomy throughout the nation and in Florida is under attack – our Florida Reproductive Justice Organizer will work to engage and mobilize communities throughout the state in response to attacks on sex education, LGBTQ rights, reproductive rights and justice, and students and families of color. Specifically, the organizer will work with allied organizations to help them strengthen and expand a youth-led coordinated campaign to respond to attacks on LGBTQ health and rights and inclusive sex education, book banning, and other educational censorship. The Organizer will create a strategy for a one-year project in Florida, coach and develop activists in different regions of the state, maintain relationships with key state and local partners, foster new relationships with state, local, and school organizations, and plan and execute trainings and actions. This is a one-year position ending in July 2024.
