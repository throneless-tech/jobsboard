The National Network of Abortion Funds seeks a visionary and courageous leader who will bring grounded, yet discerning and decisive leadership to guide the next phase of our work. The new Executive Director will be a values-aligned and compassionate leader who is unapologetically committed to abortion access and full reproductive health care for all.  

The Executive Director will lead with humility, care, and a deep commitment to leaderful practice that invests in and shares leadership with others. They will have the grit necessary to face the realities that come with the movement for abortion access and the experience to effectively lead a national member network organization that has significantly scaled up and continues to manage change.
