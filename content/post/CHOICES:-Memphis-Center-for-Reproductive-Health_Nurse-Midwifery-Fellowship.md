CHOICES will introduce recently graduated nurse midwives to CHOICES’ values and full-spectrum reproductive and sexual health model.  The year-long training program will be focused on Black midwives and will be closely aligned with reproductive and social justice principles. CHOICES’ fellows will leave the program fully equipped to provide healthcare in a more inclusive, patient-centered way and prepared to take action to dismantle systems of reproductive oppression and injustices in their own community and beyond. Qualified candidates include people who identify as Black or African American, have at least a master’s degree in nursing, completed a CNM program no more than one year ago, and have current CNM licensure or are eligible for licensure in Tennessee.
