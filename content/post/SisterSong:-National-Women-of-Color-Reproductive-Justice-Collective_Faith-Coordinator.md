The Faith Coordinator plays a dynamic and integral role within the SisterSong organization. This person will work to engage, organize, and educate people of faith on the reproductive justice framework, bridging the gap between faith and social justice activists and movements. This person will be a person of faith and/or experienced in speaking with people of faith, and if possible, a faith leader, and will work closely with SisterSongâ€™s State Coordinators and other faith campaign members to coordinate efforts between the religious refusals campaign and reproductive justice activism to heightening the impact of both.
