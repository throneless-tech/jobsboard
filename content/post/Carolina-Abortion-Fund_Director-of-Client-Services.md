The Carolina Abortion Fund (CAF) seeks a Director of Client Services to serve as a key member of the CAF leadership team, working closely with staff, volunteers, and board to support reproductive health access for North and South Carolina. This hands-on strategic leader will manage internal programming and client-facing work including helpline management and cross-partner collaboration.
 
The ideal candidate is a strong collaborator, organized, and able to build systems and processes that advance CAFâ€™s mission and impact. They are adept at working across lines of difference, building cohesion and connection in collaboration with the other co-directors, and being nimble in a constantly changing landscape of abortion access.
