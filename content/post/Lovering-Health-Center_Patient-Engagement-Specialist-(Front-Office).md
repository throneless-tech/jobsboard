Are you passionate about reproductive justice, health care access, and patient-centered care? Lovering Health Center is seeking a patient engagement specialist to serve as our primary receptionist. As the first point of contact for patients calling and checking in for their appointments, this key role is responsible for starting each patient’s healthcare experience with a welcoming, affirming, and knowledgeable approach. The health worker is an integral part of Lovering Health Center’s clinical team, and collaborates with our Nurse Practitioner, Nurse, and Lead Educator to ensure patients are scheduled in a manner that maximizes access, that they are conveyed any pre-appointment health education in a medically-accurate and non-judgmental way, and that patients are given the information needed to arrive prepared and knowledgeable about their appointment. Team players, multi-taskers, and folks with a great sense of humor will thrive in this role. LGBTQIA+ identified persons, Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC), and individuals from other historically underrepresented communities are strongly encouraged to apply.
