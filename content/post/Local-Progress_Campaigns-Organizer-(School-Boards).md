Working as part of a national program team, the Campaigns Organizer will build a cohort of school board members within the Local Progress network by fostering member leadership and engagement, collaboratively establishing a policy agenda, and advancing campaign strategies that bring school board members into collective action with each other. The Campaigns Organizer will support those members in efforts to win transformational local policy on some of the most pressing issues facing communities today. The Campaigns Organizer will need to bring a deep commitment to relational organizing and leadership development, as well as an ability to develop a range of programs, resources, and partnerships needed to support school board members committed to racial and economic justice in an era of intense backlash to those values in many school districts. This role will serve as a point person in the Local Progress network for engaging school board members across the full range of Local Progress activities and priorities.
