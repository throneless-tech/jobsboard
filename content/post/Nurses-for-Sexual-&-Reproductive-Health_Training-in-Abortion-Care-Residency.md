The TAC Residency is the nation's only hands-on abortion training program for registered nurses. This 6-month residency will run from May-November 2023. Residents will be placed at a clinical partner site in MD or IL. We are only accepting nurses (RN, LVN) who are living in IL, MO, TN, KY or the DMV area.
