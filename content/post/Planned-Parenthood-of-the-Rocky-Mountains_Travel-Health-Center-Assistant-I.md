This is the job for you if you are excited to be in the medical field and are looking to learn medical skills including blood draws and collecting and processing lab samples. You are excited to travel for work. You have a high school degree, GED or High School Equivalency (HSE) diploma, and want to provide excellent patient care to all no matter what. 
Spanish-speaking candidates preferred, but not required. 
 
Travel Information: Travel HCA's will travel to sites across Colorado, New Mexico, and Las Vegas. ~80% of the shift coverage needed tends to be along the Front Range (Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins), though, and within the Denver Metro area.
