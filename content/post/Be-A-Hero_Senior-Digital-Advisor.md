About Be a Hero/Be A Hero Action Fund 
Be A Hero PAC is a national progressive organization that works tirelessly to advocate for a more fair and just healthcare system in the United States. Founded in 2018, Be A Hero has grown rapidly and helped shape the dialogue for healthcare advocacy and accountability in America. 

With a remote team across the country, we support and advance the state-based and national fight for Medicare for All, opposition to Big Pharma, progressive COVID policy, and a host of other progressive issues. We operate through a model of empowering local progressive infrastructure through meaningful, long-term partnerships to take collective action to change national policy and politics.
