The Development Associate (the Associate) at the ACLU of Kansas is responsible for providing administrative support in all facets of the organizationâ€™s resource development work including membership, major gifts, planned giving, events, foundation relations, and donor services.

The Associate will manage the donor database, so must be somewhat familiar with database functionality and reporting, as well as have keen attention to detail. The Associate will process and acknowledge gifts/donations in a timely and personalized manner, coordinate donor mailings, and help plan events. The associate may also support grant writing and administration. Because the position is both external and internal facing, the Associate should be proficient in providing friendly customer service to diverse constituencies in the state of Kansas and be able to work as part of a team in a collaborative, cross-functional environment.
