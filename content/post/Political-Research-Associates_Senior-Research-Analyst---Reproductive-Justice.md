You are an empirically-grounded, theoretically-informed researcher and writer with a publication record or other significant body of work focused on reproductive justice or restriction thereof. You are excited by the idea of working on practice-oriented research, particularly in blocking the influence of racist, sexist/patriarchal, authoritarian, and otherwise exclusionary and oppressive movements, policies, and practices. You have a demonstrated intersectional research agenda with experience examining the ways in which attacks on reproductive justice are deeply intertwined with broader racist, misogynist, and anti-LGBTQ movements of exclusion and oppression. You are deeply committed to ideals of racial, gender, LGBTQ, and social justice with experience working with movement sectors/organizations.
