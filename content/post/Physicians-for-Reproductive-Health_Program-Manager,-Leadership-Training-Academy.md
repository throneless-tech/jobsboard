This position will manage Physicians for Reproductive Healthâ€™s flagship program, the PRH Leadership Training Academy (LTA). The LTA is a 9-month fellowship program that works with physicians to help them develop and internalize the skills they need to be powerful, effective, lifelong advocates for comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care.  The LTA Program Manager plans and leads a webinar series as well as two week-long trainings (in-person or virtual) for a cohort of 25+ LTA fellows each year. The LTA Program Manager also provides technical assistance and support to fellows as they seek out and participate in advocacy activities in the policy and media arenas as well as within medical organizations and institutions. Finally, the LTA Program Manager organizes and facilitates the annual admissions process for new LTA fellows.
