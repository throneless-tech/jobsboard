The ideal candidate will be well-versed in the inner workings of K-12 education systems administration with experience providing training and technical assistance to school district administrators, educators, and community members. They will have an understanding of Texas’ political and demographic landscape and be comfortable and effective in communicating with leaders from very diverse backgrounds. Experience working in the sexual and reproductive health field and knowledge of sexual health curricula would be helpful. A positive attitude and natural trouble-shooting abilities will be key, as many of the communities will be implementing school-based sexual health education programs for the first time – which is no easy feat! They will need as much support and encouragement as we and our partners can offer. 

At the Texas Campaign, we know that diversity makes us stronger and challenges us to think differently every day.  We are an equal opportunity employer and seek individuals of all backgrounds, gender identities, and sexual orientations to apply to this position.
