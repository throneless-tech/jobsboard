The Policy and Legal Advocacy Director will lead BISC policy development, analysis, and tracking efforts. In addition, this person will supervise BISCâ€™s Defend Direct Democracy campaign, as well as our ballot measure legislative and legal advocacy program efforts. The Policy and Legal Advocacy Director works in close collaboration, not only with their team, but with the Director of Strategic Partnerships and the Director of Capacity Building.
As a leader in the program team, the Policy and Legal Advocacy Director will co-strategize with other program directors to ensure a full integration of skill-building, policy development, legal advocacy and implementation work into the lifecycle of ballot measure campaigns when advising state-based partners that result in long-term sustainable wins that build independent power in states.
