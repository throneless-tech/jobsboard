Members and alums from the Reproductive Justice Collective NY, Advocates for Youth's Youth Abortion Support Collective, and NYC for Abortion Rights are developing a NY-based abortion doula collective! The goal is to build on our existing partnerships with advocacy organizations, support groups, and clinics, to provide in-person and virtual support. We especially want to provide support for fellow young people in their teens and twenties, but not exclusively. The community doula collective will be separate but in coalition with our existing campus doula efforts; the purpose is to work with and for the broader New York City community. The collective is open to anyone in New York with prior doula experience, training, or lived experience. If you're interested in this work and are looking for training opportunities, we recommend the BADT, DOPO, and YouthAsc trainings.
