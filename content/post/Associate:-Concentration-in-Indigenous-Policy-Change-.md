The Policy Fellow/Associate will carry key responsibilities in advancing the policy and change-making strategies of Bold Futures NM.
Bold Futures NM is seeking a candidate invested in creating long-term systemic policy change in New Mexico. We primarily move state-based legislative and administrative strategies with some engagement in both local and federal government initiatives. Bold Futures NM is looking for someone ready to show up everyday with hustle and enthusiasm. We are looking for someone EXCITED to jump into legislative work, who can carry both the big-picture vision of what we want, and hold the nuance/complexity/details needed to get there. The ideal candidate has some understanding of New Mexicoâ€™s policy and political landscape, and has experience in issue-based coalitions, collaborations and work groups. The Policy Fellow/Associate is expected to demonstrate strong written and verbal communication skills and a honed ability to think strategically. 
The right candidate will be one who is invested in growing their leadership at our organization, with explicit interest in a long-term policy position with Bold Futures NM. 
We know that many Black, Indigenous, and other people of color have not had the opportunity to gain experience in policy change work. We are open to a fellow level position--someone who is incredibly excited for the work and is ready to get it going, but may have less experience.
