Reporting to the Vice President of Campaigns, the Campaign Director will cover a portfolio of campaigns and projects, where they lead the strategic planning and decision-making and the tactical execution of our work. Across their campaign and project portfolio, the Campaign Director will run longer-term systemic change campaigns, leading our digital advocacy work and building deep relationships with allies, legislative staff, key decision-makers (whether at social media and tech companies or entertainment and cultural institutions), and relevant reporters and influencers. Alongside these longer-term campaigns, the Campaign Director will also opportunistically run creative and strategic digital-first, rapid-response campaigns in response to breaking news or cultural moments as a tactic to advance campaign goals, promote feminist values, and grow our community of online activists.
