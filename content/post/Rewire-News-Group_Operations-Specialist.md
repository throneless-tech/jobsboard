Rewire News Group (rewirenewsgroup.com) is the only media organization exclusively dedicated to reporting on reproductive and sexual health, rights, and justice. Rewire News Group (RNG) is wrapping up our first 10 years as an independent media organization at a time that is both difficult and full of opportunity in our space. As we launch into our next ten years, we have an exciting opening for an operations specialist (non-exempt) to support the organizationâ€™s finance, operations, and human resources functions. Ideal candidates are versatile; flexible; and both enjoy and work well with people, numbers, and systems.
