The CFO will support the multi-year transition from a traditional headquarter centered international non-governmental organization (NGO) to a networked organization. The Ipas Impact Network is based on the framework of shared leadership and ownership: decisions are made closest to the point of impact, culture and practices emphasize equity and less hierarchy, operating context and program impact are balanced with financial management and there is mutual accountability and shared responsibility. The CFO is expected to contribute to this transition by actively working to dismantle the power structures, learned behaviors and bias that enable the systems of white supremacy and colonialism that are inherent in the traditional international development sector. In addition, the CFO will contribute to the success of the Ipas Impact Network by working closely with the transition working groups, Network
coordinators and the Network Leadership Group to be responsive to the new operating model and provide critical data points to identify the best cost and revenue model for the Ipas network going forward.
