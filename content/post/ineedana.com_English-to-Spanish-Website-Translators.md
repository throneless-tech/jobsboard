ineedana.com is hiring remote, part-time, contract translators to facilitate the translation of their website from English to Spanish. Pay is $40/hr. Translation is needed for roughly 15 landing pages and  700+ clinic profiles. We believe the effort to translate will be approximately 125 hours of work total for initial translations. We plan to hire 2 - 3 translators to work on this project together.

At minimum, we require that applicants be fluent in Spanish and English and have a passion for abortion access. We would prefer folks have experience in helping people seek abortion services, perhaps in a clinic setting or as a volunteer at an abortion fund.
