As the Manager of Technical Assistance, you are the organization’s leader in supporting primary care clinicians and practices around the US to integrate full-spectrum sexual and reproductive health care, especially abortion and EPL care. With the support of the Director of Programs and Evaluation, you oversee the organization’s technical assistance efforts, including a new virtual learning collaborative program to bring multidisciplinary teams within primary care sites together to build their skills and confidence to dismantle institutional barriers to providing medication abortion and EPL care. You also provide one-on-one technical assistance to clinicians and sites within and outside of the Reproductive Health Access Network. You play a critical role in developing and maintaining partnerships that promote this work. And you may take part in advocacy and organizing efforts within federal-, state-, and city-based coalitions to ensure efforts to expand access to sexual and reproductive health care also meet the needs of primary care settings, especially Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).
