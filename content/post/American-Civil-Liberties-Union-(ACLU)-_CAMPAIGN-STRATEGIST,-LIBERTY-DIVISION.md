The National Political Advocacy Department (NPAD) works to strengthen the efforts of the ACLU at the federal, state, and local levels of government. The department harnesses the political power that comes from having more than eleven million members and supporters, as well as affiliates in every state. Through issue campaigns buttressed by grassroots organizing, direct lobbying, leveraging earned and paid media and other modern tactics, the ACLU seeks to achieve significant policy and political change in the legislative, administrative and electoral arenas. Reporting to the Deputy Director of the Liberty Division, the Campaign Strategist will work with national staff and ACLU affiliates to design, build, and execute campaigns directed at advancing civil liberties and civil rights by reaching specific political/policy outcomes. The Campaign Strategist will help drive programmatic work related to advancing and defending reproductive freedom in the states through legislative and administrative advocacy, candidate and ballot measure electoral campaigns, and organizing.
