Scale for Change is hiring for multiple canvassers positions in Phoenix, AZ! We’re also looking for staff willing to travel to peak locations in our national canvasser role. 

Apply at scaleforchange.org/get-hired. We strongly encourage women, people of color, working-class, and LGBTQ people, as well as those with disabilities, to apply. 

As a canvasser, you will travel door to door to talk about issue campaigns. You will be responsible for having a certain number of conversations per day. You will not fundraise. If you’re fired up and ready to organize in your community, we urge you to apply!
 
There are no education requirements and training will be provided to all new team members. We offer flexible schedules, and all canvassers make at least $25/hr in Phoenix with the opportunity for promotion to team lead, and bonuses for sign-on, recruitment, & performance.
