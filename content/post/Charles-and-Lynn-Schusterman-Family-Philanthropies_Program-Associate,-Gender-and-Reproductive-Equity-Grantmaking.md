The Program Associate (PA) is a member of the Gender and Reproductive Equity (GRE) team, and will be based in Schusterman’s Washington, DC or New York, NY offices. The PA supports the GRE team to develop, implement and assess grantmaking strategies that increase women’s and gender non-conforming people’s: 1) political power and leadership; 2) knowledge, freedom, and power to determine their reproductive lives; 3) economic power; and 4) freedom from sexual harassment and violence. The PA will also play an essential role in the administration and coordination of the GRE team, supporting logistics, scheduling, and more. The PA understands how intersecting forms of oppression and discrimination shape gender and reproductive equity and is committed to building the power of Black, Indigenous and People of Color movements to respond. This role is an excellent fit for someone with some background in our issue areas who is seeking to learn more about philanthropy, the diverse fields and organizations the GRE team funds, and current challenges and strategies of the movements we support.
