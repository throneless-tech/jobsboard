The Program Associate (PA) supports the Gender and Reproductive Equity (GRE) team to develop, implement and assess grantmaking strategies that increase women’s and gender non-conforming people’s: 1) political power and leadership; 2) knowledge, freedom and power to determine their reproductive lives; 3) economic power; and 4) freedom from sexual harassment and violence. The PA understands how intersecting forms of oppression and discrimination shape gender and reproductive equity and is committed to building the power of Black, Indigenous and People of Color movements to respond. The PA will join a team of six and will be based in our Washington, DC or New York, NY office.
