RHEDI works to expand patient-centered abortion and contraception training in family medicine residencies, informed by a Reproductive Justice framework that centers marginalized communities. We also strive to diversify the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) workforce by supporting BIPOC students, residents, and faculty. We are seeking a part-time Development Consultant to take a primary role in shaping our fundraising strategy, cultivating relationships with new and existing funders, and developing proposals for foundations and fundraising campaigns.
