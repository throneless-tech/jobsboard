About National Women’s Health Network
For nearly 50 years, the National Women’s Health Network (NWHN) has been a leading voice for women’s healthcare access and equity. We are consumer activists supported by a national membership of thousands of advocates. We shape policy and support consumer health decisions; monitor the actions of Federal regulatory and funding agencies, the healthcare industry, and the health professions; identify and expose health care abuses; and mobilize grassroots action for women’s health.

The Opportunity
NWHN is seeking a visionary executive with successful experience leading a progressive advocacy or policy organization or campaign. The Executive Director will balance internal responsibilities – building a strong operational infrastructure, team, and culture – with external demands – engaging with our members, policymakers, funders, and the media.

They will have earned a reputation for building strong, trusted relationships with diverse stakeholders, from policymakers to activists to funders to the media and across every race, ethnicity, age, ability, socio-economic level, and sexual orientation. They will come with a creative, flexible, strategic, and solution-oriented mindset and be an exceptional listener and communicator.

Our ideal candidate will have experience in and a strong commitment to women’s health policy. However, we are open to considering candidates who can demonstrate a compelling commitment to our mission and a proven ability to climb a steep learning curve. Previous experience engaging with a Board of Directors, developing and implementing a strategic plan, and building effective funding partnerships are all essential ingredients of our ideal candidate.
