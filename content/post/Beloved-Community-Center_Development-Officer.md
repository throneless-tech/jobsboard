The Beloved Community Center (BCC), founded in Greensboro in 1991, is primarily a “place-based” community building organization with state and national reach. In 2022, the Beloved Community Center is poised to deepen and broaden its important organizing for racial and economic justice in Greensboro, and on state and national levels. BCC led Greensboro to organize the nation’s first Truth and Community Reconciliation process, drawing from international models. BCC is currently working with partners and constituents
toward the development of a North Carolina Truth, Justice and Reconciliation process to serve as a model and resource for emerging national truth formations. In this important moment, BCC is searching for a development officer to work as a key part of our growing executive team. From day one, the development officer will have an immediate impact on our productivity -- streamlining strategic fundraising initiatives, overseeing the organizational fundraising program, and ensuring internal communication channels related to
fundraising are open – to facilitate a scaling-up of our work. The ideal candidate will have proven experience in a management role, with a strong understanding of racial and economic justice organizing.
