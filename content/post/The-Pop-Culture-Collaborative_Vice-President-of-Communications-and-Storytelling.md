The Pop Culture Collaborative is seeking an experienced visionary to be its first Vice President of Communications and Storytelling. This senior leader will report to the Chief Strategy Officer and collaboratively lead within a broader, entrepreneurial team to advance the organizationâ€™s ambitious field-building and impact goals by designing, creating and executing a robust brand, communications, and storytelling strategy to audience stakeholders across multiple sectors, including: leaders within philanthropic and investor communities, social justice movements, as well as entertainment and other mass media industries. This strategy will help the Collaborative align an expanding field of artists, movement leaders, cultural strategists, producers, designers, philanthropic leaders, and public figures around a visionary goal to ignite public yearning for a just and pluralist society through narrative change and pop culture.

The VP of Communications and Storytelling requires entrepreneurial instincts, brand strategy expertise, public relations sensibilities, and editorial and content production experience. The successful candidate will work with self-direction, a collaborative spirit, a passion for pop culture and social justice, and an advanced level of social emotional intelligence.
