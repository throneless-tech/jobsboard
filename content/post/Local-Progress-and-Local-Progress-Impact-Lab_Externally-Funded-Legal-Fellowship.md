This is an exciting opportunity for recent law school graduates who are eager to build the legal and policy capacity of the Local Progress network, which is comprised of elected officials serving in cities and counties, and on school boards, as well as closely collaborate with these members in working hand-in-hand with impacted communities to win and defend transformational local policy on some of the most pressing issues facing communities today. Fellows will provide timely resources, strategy, and collaboration to Local Progress members on the forefront of these efforts and will require digging in on questions facing our members day-to-day; for example, on preemption, drafting ordinances, etc.
