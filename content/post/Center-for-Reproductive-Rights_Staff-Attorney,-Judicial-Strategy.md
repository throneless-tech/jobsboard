The staff attorney will work closely with the senior attorney, Judicial Strategy who is leading our new initiatives focused on state constitutions and state courts. Deepening existing state court strategies, and developing potential new bodies of work, are a priority under the Center’s five-year strategic plan. The ideal candidate will be collaborative, flexible, creative, and bring ideas or experience on how to advance legal and judicial goals in partnership and coalition with state advocates. The staff attorney will work to raise awareness about the importance of state judiciaries and threats to the independence of state courts that impact reproductive rights and access; support and connect local and national cross-issue coalitions and campaigns committed to strengthening state courts; and conduct research specific to state courts and judicial pipeline building in the Center’s priority litigation and advocacy states. The staff attorney will collaborate regularly with other JS team members, and Center staff and teams, in particular the state advocacy and policy team and litigation team.
