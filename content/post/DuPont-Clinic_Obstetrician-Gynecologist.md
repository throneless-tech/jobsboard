We seek an outstanding obstetrician-gynecologist to provide abortion care in all-trimesters. This person will provide high-quality patient care, excellent customer service, ensure efficient patient flow, ensure a safe clinic environment, and work collaboratively with all team members to create a great workplace. The obstetrician-gynecologist will work 12-24 weeks per year, as either 3-day or 4-day weeks.
