The Integrated Voter Engagement (IVE) Community Outreach Coordinator is a member of the IVE Team and is responsible for providing key leadership in implementing our voter engagement program in Pennsylvania to build power among Black women, queer folks, and marginalized individuals who are either unregistered or infrequent voters. The IVE Community Outreach Coordinator is key in connecting this voter base to the local and national  Reproductive Justice movement. This position requires an outgoing, experienced, results-driven self-starter with a professional background in voter engagement, community organizing, and/or leadership development. A background in social justice, racial justice, and/or Reproductive Justice or Health is key for this role. The IVE Community Outreach Coordinator mobilizes Black people of all genders and backgrounds, builds organizational visibility, and is dedicated to the health and well-being of those we serve in Pittsburgh. The selected candidate will represent the interests of New Voices and our constituents in various settings through voter engagement coalitions, partnerships, and alliances and will be required to travel as needed to support the goals of the organization.
