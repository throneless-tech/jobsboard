We are looking for someone with strong writing and organizational skills who is enthusiastic about our mission to advance sexual and reproductive autonomy, choices, and health worldwide. This role will provide communications and administrative support across multiple projects in the organization: Free the Pill, Ibis’s campaign focused on moving birth control pills over the counter in the United States; abortion-focused projects; and Ibis’s organizational communications. In February, or as soon as public health conditions permit, Ibis will pilot a model of hybrid work where all staff (excluding permanently remote staff) will work from their local offices at least two days per week. Ibis requires all employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19. This position will be based in the Cambridge or Oakland office, with the expectation of at least two days per week of in-office work.
