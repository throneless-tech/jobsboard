Reporting to the Associate Director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law, the Administrative and Communications Officer will provide administrative, communications and programmatic support to the Center and its initiatives: The Law, Rights, and Religion Project (LRRP), the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) Project, and the Racial Justice Project (RJP). The goal of this position is to amplify the Center’s ability to make an impact on law and policy, and to reach a wider audience—including policymakers, funders and donors, journalists, community organizations and activists, youth, and the general public. We are excited to bring on someone who is passionate about equality, gender justice, racial justice, LGBTQ+ rights, and reproductive rights.
