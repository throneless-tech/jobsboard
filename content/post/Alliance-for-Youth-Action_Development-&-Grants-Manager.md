The Alliance for Youth Action (along with our sister 501c3 organization the Alliance for Youth Organizing) is searching for a Development and Grants Manager who will join the Alliance’s Development Department to support fundraising efforts to raise $5million+ in 2021 for the nation’s leading youth organizing network. Since our inception, our network has led on some of the most innovative and exciting electoral and issue advocacy work across the country. The Development and Grants Manager will head our grant seeking and reporting processes, manage our grant tracking systems and database, support other departmental fundraising efforts, and work to strengthen fundraising across our network through capacity building support.
