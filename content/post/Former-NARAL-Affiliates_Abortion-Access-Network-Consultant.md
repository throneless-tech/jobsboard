A group of 13 state-based organizations are seeking a consultant to help build an innovative, ground-up network structure that helps relieve operational burdens and supports coordination of state- and locally-led reproductive and abortion advocacy groups. Our vision is to help ensure that local and state-based organizations have the support they need to succeed in the post-Dobbs landscape. The consultant will, through an inclusive and effective stakeholder engagement and organizational design process, determine an equity-focused structure for an operational support network for state- and local-level reproductive freedom advocacy nonprofits.
