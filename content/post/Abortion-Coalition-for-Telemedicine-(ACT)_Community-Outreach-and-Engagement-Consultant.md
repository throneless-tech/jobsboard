This project will expand and improve access to safe, legal telemedicine abortion services and/or information for people in states where abortion is banned or restricted and with a focus on addressing racial and economic inequities in access to abortion. Focus will be on building relationships with community activists and trusted reproductive healthcare messengers and developing outreach strategies for raising awareness. Because this is a pilot project, ACT will adopt a proactive and flexible approach to testing different methods of outreach and engagement with community groups. The goal will be to determine how to best provide information and resources concerning telemedicine abortion as an option for pregnant people in restrictive states and under-resourced communities where there is the greatest need.
