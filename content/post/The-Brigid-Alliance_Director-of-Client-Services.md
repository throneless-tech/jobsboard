More people than ever before are being forced to travel for abortion care. The Brigid Alliance is working to build a country where abortion care is borderless, burden-free, and accessible to all, however, there is an epic crisis of abortion access in the United States with many states now having total or near-total bans on abortion and it doesnâ€™t stop there. With the ever-changing legal landscape, many more states are still at risk of implementing these bans. Today, nearly a year after the Supreme Court ruled to dismantle Roe v. Wade, the number of people who need to travel for abortion care has quadrupled, straining limited resources already in existence and requiring individuals to cover hundreds of miles from home to receive such critical care. The Brigid Alliance now seeks a new Director of Client Services who will work in partnership with the Interim Executive Director in leading and charting the next phase of vision and strategy for client services. The Director will oversee and support a multi-talented, collaborative team of passionate and dedicated client-facing coordinators who are highly trained to deliver non-judgmental, trauma informed and compassionate support to abortion seekers. The Director will hire, train and be a mentor to staff and build a strong team through open communication and collaborative decision-making. The work ahead calls for a leader who has vision and passion for reproductive justice, bringing change and organizational management experience, with a value driven, economic justice and racial justice lens. This Director will be highly relational working across all levels of the organization to build and strengthen internal and external partnerships and collaboration efforts, is excited by data and systems improvement, bringing a transparent and compassionate eye to case management and where The Brigid Alliance might best plug into the network and framework in service of their clients and communities.
