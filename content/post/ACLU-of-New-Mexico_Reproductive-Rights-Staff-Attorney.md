ACLU of New Mexico (ACLU-NM) works to protect and advance justice, liberty, and equity as guaranteed by the constitutions of New Mexico and the United States. As the state affiliate of the premiere civil rights and civil liberties organization in the country, ACLU-NM fights in the courts, in the legislature, and in its communities to ensure that justice, liberty, and equity are realities for all people. With reproductive freedom under attack across the nation, the ACLU-NM is investing in the addition of a Reproductive Rights Staff Attorney to its legal team. The Reproductive Rights Staff Attorney will ground their work in an intersectional reproductive justice framework and collaborate with and among communities across the state to protect and advance reproductive rights, health, and justice.
