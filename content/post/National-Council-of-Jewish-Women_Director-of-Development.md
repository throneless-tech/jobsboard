About the Position:

National Council of Jewish Women seeks a Director of Development to design and implement a bold fundraising growth strategy that will more than double NCJW’s philanthropic revenue over the next few years. The successful candidate will lead a development team and empower an energetic lay leadership to complement and enhance their work. NCJW is the leading Jewish women’s organization fighting for equal pay, affordable child care, paid leave, abortion access, and more. With these issues all under attack, this is a pivotal time to grow our impact through increased revenue.
