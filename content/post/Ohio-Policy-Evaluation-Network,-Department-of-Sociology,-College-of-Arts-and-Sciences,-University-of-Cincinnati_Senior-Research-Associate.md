We seek an exceptional scholar with a strong background and interest in reproductive health research, including health policy, abortion, and contraception for a research associate position at the University of Cincinnati. The research associate will work closely with Michelle McGowan (Pediatrics and Womenâ€™s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies) and Danielle Bessett (Sociology) on studies focused on abortion clinic closures and their effects on abortion-seeking experiences and health system impacts in Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky. We expect data collection to be challenging and data analysis to be complex. The research associate will also be involved in analysis and interpretation of findings, with an emphasis on disseminating results with principal investigators and co-investigators.
