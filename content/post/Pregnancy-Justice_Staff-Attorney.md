Pregnancy Justice seeks a dedicated and motivated litigator with a minimum of five (5) years experience in criminal or civil litigation at the trial and/or appellate levels with a demonstrated commitment to public education, partnerships, and engaging with grassroots organizations and community members to inform the legal work. 

Working within Pregnancy Justiceâ€™s legal team, and with local counsel, pro bono firms, experts, and state-based advocates, the Staff Attorney performs a variety of functions independently and collaboratively under the supervision of a senior staff attorney, including providing legal analysis and advice regarding cases as well as policy proposals; developing and litigating new and existing cases around the country; and leveraging cases, where appropriate, as a mechanism to hold systems accountable, make policy change, and shift narratives and public opinion. 

All Pregnancy Justice employees must be able to model and uphold the organizational culture while engaging with stakeholders, partners and Pregnancy Justice staff with the highest level of integrity, including through honest and open communication; provide and request constructive feedback with emotional intelligence and with the intent of nurturing greater understanding and growth; and embrace, respect and value the rich range of perspectives and experience of a diverse and heterogeneous staff. We recognize and appreciate that our work is better for having varied participants and thought partners.
