NAPAWF is the only organization focused on building power with Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) women and girls to influence critical decisions that affect our lives, our families and our communities. Using a reproductive justice framework, we elevate AAPI women and girls to impact policy and drive systemic change in the United States. The Policy Manager will help lead NAPAWF's policy advocacy goals on national, state and local levels in our priority areas of reproductive justice, immigrant rights, and economic justice. The Policy Manager will be responsible for driving forward the policy and advocacy arm of the organization.
