ICAN! Mission: Illinois Contraceptive Access Now (ICAN!) is a statewide initiative to advance contraceptive health equity by de-siloing, de-stigmatizing, and normalizing birth control as basic health care. We believe that every person should have the ability to decide if, when, and under what circumstances to be pregnant and parent.

Community Advisory Board (CAB) Charge: The CAB guides all aspects of ICAN!'s work to transform how contraceptive care is delivered, accessed, and paid for. CAB members are patients of reproductive age, community health providers, and social service providers who will work to:

1. Share their personal and their communityâ€™s experiences with sexual/reproductive health care
2. Inform ICAN!'s educational and training materials, digital tool development, and policy implementation.
3. Promote ICAN! in their communities and online.
4. Represent the needs and concerns of their communities.

We honor diverse identities, backgrounds, and perspectives and seek to create an affirming space where everyone feels welcome, heard, and empowered to shape our work at ICAN!.

Expectations of active members:  
Attend at least 9 monthly meetings (out of 12 total in the year)  
Regularly provide feedback on ICAN! materials, digital tools, social content, and policy implementation.  
Facilitate introductions to organizations in their networks. 
Serve as ambassadors for ICAN! within the community by attending outreach events and/or sharing information on their social platforms.
