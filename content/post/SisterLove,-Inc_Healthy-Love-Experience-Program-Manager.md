OVERVIEW:
The Program Manager is responsible for the provision of service delivery for the Healthy Love Experience. Areas of oversight include: 1. Healthy Education and Prevention Program: SisterLove’s sexual health education, advocacy, and prevention activities, including HIV, Hepatitis C, Pregnancy, STI testing, prevention counseling and/or linkage to care and community resources, and PrEP/PEP Navigation. 2. Healthy Love Bus: The Healthy Love Bus is our mobile unit that provides comprehensive Healthy Love Experience services on wheels - delivering HIV/STI/Hepatitis C testing, sexual and reproductive health education, prevention, advocacy, and linkage to care and resources to underserved communities. In 2024, SisterLove plans to expand HLB services to include sexual and reproductive healthcare on the bus and will hire a Nurse Practitioner to provide clinical care. 3. Healthy Love Party: Healthy Love Party (HLP) Workshops are SisterLove’s signature sexual health and prevention education intervention.  HLP workshops are effective, evidence-based interventions created, implemented, and evaluated in partnership with the CDC. The workshops are one-time group-level interventions incorporating information, empowerment, skills-building, and risk assessment for women, girls, and other populations at substantial risk for HIV and STIs. 4. Train the trainer and curricular development for projects that work at the intersections of HIV and Intimate Partner/Domestic Violence.
