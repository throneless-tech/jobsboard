The Communications Assistant will play a central role in daily and fundraising communications in concert with CASNâ€™s volunteer social media team. This position is up to 20 hours per week for 3 months, with a potential option for an extension. This role will consist of content creation for various social media platforms, communicating with CASN supporters through our quarterly newsletter, and amplifying fundraising campaigns. This is a remote role with a predominantly volunteer organization; self-direction, collaboration, and values alignment are crucial. This position will require occasional work on evenings or weekends to allow collaboration with the Board of Directors. This position may require in-person attendance at meetings or events in the future, therefore, applicants must reside in Texas, preferably the Houston area. The list of responsibilities and requirements are below.
