MA is at the forefront of smart policy and strategic organizing to win real benefits for communities and workers of color who too often have been left behind. As the Illinois Organizer, you will be responsible for leading and growing the network of workers, grassroots community members, and coalition partners that are engaged in our campaigns to win community benefits agreements and worker-centered equity policies. The Organizer pays special attention to organizing key stakeholders that can include workers at a specific worksite, grassroots community members in key geographic areas, and/or organizational and union partners to advance a shared vision of racial equity and worker power.
