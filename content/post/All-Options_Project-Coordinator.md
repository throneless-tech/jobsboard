All-Options is hiring a new Project Coordinator for a grant-funded collaborative research project with Ibis Reproductive Health. The Project Coordinator (PC) will be primarily responsible for coordinating activities related to: 1) research on the impact of remote non-medical abortion support on the experiences and attitudes of people seeking abortion care, including callers to our national Talkline, and 2) collaborations that allow for the expansion of safe, effective, remotely-provided abortion support that is responsive to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Note: We are defining non-medical abortion support here as abortion doulas, handholders, and hotline/talkline staffers, who offer emotional, informational, logistical, physical, and/or spiritual support to clients before, during, and/or after an abortion.
