Care in Action (CiA) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to fighting for fairness for the millions of caregivers and domestic workers in the United States, most of whom are women of color and immigrant women. Care in Action works to elevate the voices of women of color and advocates for an agenda that supports their ability to work and care for their families, with dignity. We provide the tools, training, and community that working families need to make their voices heard, and we organize and advocate for respect, recognition, and policies that support economic opportunity and equity.
