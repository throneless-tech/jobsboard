The Development and Communications Director (DCD) is an exciting opportunity for a highly motivated fundraising professional with marketing/communications experience to assume a critical role in a fast-paced grassroots advocacy organization. The successful DCD is a mission-focused, collaborative, results-driven, and creative leader with experience in growing a diverse revenue portfolio and relationships, and building and amplifying a positive brand position. Reporting directly to the Executive Director, the DCDâ€™s primary responsibility is to develop, lead, and manage the development and communications strategies, goals, and functions of NARAL Pro-Choice Washington. The objective of this position is to ensure sufficient and sustainable resources are brought in to advance our mission, and that high-level strategic decisions are made to steward major donors, sponsors, and foundations towards giving to NARAL Pro-Choice Washington & NARAL Pro-Choice Washington Foundation. A successful DCD will be excited by the opportunity to be creative while strengthening both traditional and new fundraising channels. NARAL Pro-Choice Washington is committed to living our values throughout our work, so a successful DCD will also be comfortable with the principles of community-centric fundraising (CCF).
