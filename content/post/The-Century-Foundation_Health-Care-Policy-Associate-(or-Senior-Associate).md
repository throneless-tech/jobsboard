The Century Foundation (TCF), is a progressive, independent think tank, seeking a policy associate to join the health care team, providing research and organizing support for TCF’s work on maternal health and related issues of health coverage, health disparities, and reproductive rights and justice. TCF’s Health Care Program provides analysis and recommendations about how to improve health care in the United States. Our work investigates ways to expand access to health care for all Americans, make health care more affordable and efficient, and close health care gaps for women and people of color. The associate is based in Washington, DC and will work closely with TCF health care director and senior fellow Dr. Jamila Taylor. They will engage in research and communications to support stronger policies and programs to address racial disparities in health care.
