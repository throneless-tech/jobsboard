Our Development and Communications Department is looking for a temporary Communications Intern to help us manage our external communication channels. This includes managing email lists and helping to develop social media content. By the end of the internship, the intern will have a portfolio of social media, print and digital advertising content. They will also have a clear understanding of how communication departments operate in a non-profit medical facility.
