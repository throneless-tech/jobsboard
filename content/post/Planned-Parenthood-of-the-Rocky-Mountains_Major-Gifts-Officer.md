Your days will be filled with developing and implementing a plan and strategies that engage prospects in considering the importance of a community health center and later in financially supporting the project. Activities will include but are not limited to prospect discovery work, figuring out how to get in front of people to start the engagement process, lining up the right PPRM people (which might or might not be this person, depending on the prospect), organizing key meeting, and drafting written materials. You will coordinate with senior development, executive, program staff, and key volunteers with a focus on elevating current giving and completing solicitations for major gifts in support of PPRM priorities.  You may attend meetings and events before and after business hours and may work some evenings and weekends. You will travel across New Mexico regularly and throughout our affiliate region occasionally.
