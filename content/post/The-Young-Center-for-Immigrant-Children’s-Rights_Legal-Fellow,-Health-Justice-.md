The Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights invites applications for the position of Legal Fellow, Health Justice, to be based in one of the Young Center’s eight locations (Chicago, Harlingen, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Phoenix, San Antonio, and Washington, DC). This position is full-time and is a two-year fellowship from 2023-2025. The fellowship will not renew or convert into permanent employment at the Young Center. The Legal Fellow, Health Justice, will support the work of the Young Center’s policy team by engaging in legal and policy advocacy towards ensuring access to reproductive health care for unaccompanied immigrant youth in federal government custody. The Fellow will conduct legal research and data analysis related to reproductive health care access for immigrant youth and may work on amicus briefs to support legal challenges to barriers to reproductive health care for immigrant youth. The Fellow will be supervised by the Director of Policy and Litigation. We encourage applications from recent law school graduates, including those completing judicial clerkships, as well as practicing attorneys who are seeking to expand their experience in policy advocacy and with an interest in working at the intersection of reproductive justice, children’s rights, and immigrant rights.
