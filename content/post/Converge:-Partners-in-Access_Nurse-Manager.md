Converge: Partners in Access is dedicated to ensuring all people can access high quality reproductive and sexual healthcare when they need it, how they need it and where they live. In September 2023, Converge was awarded a $3.9M federal grant to expand its programs into Tennessee. Reporting to the Tennessee Title X Director, the Nurse Manager will support the roll-out and ongoing delivery of the Title X program, provide clinical support to a network of 21 (and growing to 50) healthcare providers, and ultimately bring essential family planning healthcare to Tennessee residents.
