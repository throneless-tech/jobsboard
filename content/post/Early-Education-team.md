The Director of Community Partnerships on the Income Security and Child Care/Early Education team works to identify, cultivate, and support a diverse group of leaders in the field focused on advancing women and families’ economic security and opportunity; and to facilitate development and advancement of cross-cutting policies and programs reflecting income security and child care/early learning priorities, in partnership with this group and Law Center staff. The Director focuses specifically on investing and supporting the leadership of women of color and other women facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.

Working in close partnership with other Center staff, the Director of Community Partnerships plays a key role in advancing the Law Center’s mission, ensuring that NWLC’s research, policy, and advocacy strategies on child care, early education, budget, taxes, and poverty center the voices and experiences of women of color and women with low incomes. In addition, the Director leverages the Law Center’s resources to invest in a pipeline of diverse leaders working on these issues.
