The Climate Justice Senior Strategist will work at the behest of our grassroots affiliates to drive razor-sharp local and state campaigns that leverage the Inflation Reduction Act to win climate, jobs, and justice while helping to develop and implement a national campaign that takes on the corporations at the root of the crisis. You will ensure that all campaign work advances a base and power-building strategy, as that is at the center of everything that we do.
