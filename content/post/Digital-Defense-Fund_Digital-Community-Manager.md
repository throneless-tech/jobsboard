The Community Manager will manage and engage the members of the Techies for Reproductive Justice (T4RJ) community. T4RJ is a coalition space for technologists to convene to build connection, trust, tech literacy, and capacity within the abortion access movement and across values-aligned movements. The T4RJ community exists in Slack and has monthly presentation-style events and abortion access focused technical projects to volunteer on. At DDF, we welcome flexibility, ownership, and creativity in engagement. Youâ€™ll have the chance to work side by side with very passionate and enthusiastic T4RJers, and be a partner in the creation of our community.
