We are looking for a VP of Communications and Research to set overarching strategy for NARAL’s communications and research departments, including engaging key stakeholders. The VP of Communications and Research will oversee the deployment of creative content to reach key audiences and stakeholders, including grasstops and corporate leaders. An integral member of NARAL’s executive team, this person will oversee, develop and implement an aggressive communications and research strategy. They will leverage NARAL’s research at the national and state level in order to lift up NARAL’s campaigns, initiatives, political programs, and long-term vision for reproductive freedom, while pulling back the curtain on the anti-choice movement and countering their harmful influence on our democracy.
