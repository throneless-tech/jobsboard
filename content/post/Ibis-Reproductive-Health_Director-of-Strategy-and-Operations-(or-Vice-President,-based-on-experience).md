Ibis Reproductive Health seeks a creative, collaborative, and dynamic leader to join our Senior Management Team as the Director (or VP) of Strategy and Operations. Over the last five years Ibis has grown significantly. We are extremely proud of our accomplishments since we were founded in 2002, believe our approaches to research and evidence-based advocacy fill an important gap in the reproductive health and rights field, and are committed to doing research and running our organization in ways that advance racial justice. Please see our description of our commitment to justice and equity here and our statement on what it means to approach research with a justice and equity lens here.  A summary of our 2019-2022 strategic plan is here.

The Director (or VP) of Strategy and Operations will partner with the Ibis President and the Senior Management Team to support our ongoing organizational transformation and build/manage internal systems to monitor progress toward our strategic objectives and goals, ensure continued and clear communication across the organization, partner with our research and development and communications teams to disseminate our research, and play a key role in maintaining Ibisâ€™s partnerships and representing Ibis with key stakeholders. This position can be based in any of our three offices. At present all staff have the option to work remotely or in offices following local public health guidance. When public health conditions related to COVID-19 allow, full-time work in offices will resume.
