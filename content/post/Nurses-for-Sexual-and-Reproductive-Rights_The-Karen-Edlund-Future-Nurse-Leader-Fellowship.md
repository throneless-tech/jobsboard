The Karen Edlund Future Nurse Leader Fellowship fuels nursing students to leverage their power and become leaders in SRH, reproductive rights and reproductive justice. Through intentional support and development of historically excluded nurses- specifically people who identify as Black, Latinx and/or Indigenous, we believe we can shift power to not only include but celebrate comprehensive sexual and reproductive health. This fellowship is an opportunity to expand your knowledge, challenge harmful oppressive systems (such as white supremacy, classism, homophobia) and develop a community of support as you move into your nursing career. This is a 6-month fellowship from July 2022- December 2022. Applications are open till May 20th, 2022. 
*Nursing students of all degrees welcome to apply (LPN, ASN, BSN, MSN, DNP, RN Bridge)
