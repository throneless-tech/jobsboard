The Engagement & Communications Manager is a new position that will have responsibilities both for WomenCount and EWA. This role seeks to raise awareness about our work and increase engagement across multiple audiences, including donors, candidates, other organizations, key stakeholders in the political ecosystem, and digital communities. Although WomenCount and EWA have existed for several election cycles, both efforts are undergoing major expansion. Communications and engagement are a central priority of this next phase of our evolution, and the person in this role will have an opportunity to help develop the strategy for our plans to increase engagement.
