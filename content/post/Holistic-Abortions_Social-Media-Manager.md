Holistic is committed to continuing to share tools and knowledge about body literacy and shifting the way we think, talk and experience abortions.  We are looking for someone to join our small team who is familiar with the socials (IG, Tiktok, ect). You gotta be all in with abortion and reproductive justice. You gotta be down with plants and magic and science. The position requires someone who can think strategically and be quick on their toes (cuz you know the internet can be a wild place). Please have experience in Canva, Google Docs, and Planoly (or another scheduling app). Getting excited about calendars and a well-organized spreadsheet is a BIG plus.  5-7 hours of remote work per week.
If you are interested, please email holisticabxshop@gmail.com a resume and answer the question “What would bodily autonomy mean to you and your community?” If you think you know someone who may be interested, please forward this!
