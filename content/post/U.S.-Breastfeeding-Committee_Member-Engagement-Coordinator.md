The Membership Engagement Coordinator is a trusted and critical member of the Engagement and Training Team and supports the management of USBCâ€™s programs and services for prospective, new and current members. We are looking for an outgoing, friendly, and approachable Member Engagement Coordinator who will support the current and prospective USBC members through relationship building, correspondence, and recordkeeping under the direction of the Senior Manager. In addition, the Member Engagement Coordinator will be responsible for maintaining CRM (customer database), preparing various reports, and keeping in touch with members and other stakeholders.
USBC can only accept applications from residents of CA, IL, MD, MA, or OR, where employer registration is already established. All positions at USBC are remote, though semi-annual travel to events is expected to resume when conditions allow.
