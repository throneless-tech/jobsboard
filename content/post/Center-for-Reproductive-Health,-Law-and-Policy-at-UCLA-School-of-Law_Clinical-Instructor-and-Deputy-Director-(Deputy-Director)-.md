The Center for Reproductive Health, Law and Policy at UCLA School of Law seeks a Clinical Instructor and Deputy Director (Deputy Director) with sustained experience in the practice of reproductive rights law and policy to join the Centerâ€™s senior management team. The Center will generate innovative ideas at the intersection of reproductive health and rights scholarship and practice; serve as a hub for transforming those ideas into meaningful changes in policy at the local, state, and national levels; and empower students with unique opportunities for experiential learning through work with academics, practitioners, policymakers, and activists.
The Deputy Director will be responsible for a broad range of academic and administrative functions in the Center, with a primary focus on teaching experiential courses affiliated with the Center, creating other non-curricular opportunities for UCLA students and alumni, participating in research and advocacy on reproductive health law and policy issues, designing and executing Center conferences and convenings, and an array of other programmatic, administrative, and teaching engagements.
