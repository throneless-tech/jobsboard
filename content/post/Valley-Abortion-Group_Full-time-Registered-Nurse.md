Valley Abortion Group (VAG) is seeking a full-time nurse to join our all trimester abortion clinic. This is an excellent opportunity to be part of a progressive healthcare organization committed to addressing some of the most pressing and challenging equity and social justice issues throughout the nation. The ideal candidate will have experience in reproductive health care, be familiar or have an interest in all trimester abortion and contraception care, and experience, or interest in learning, to provide moderate sedation. Eligible candidates require a nursing degree. Our clinic is located on traditional, unceded Tiwa territory, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. VAG is the first queer and BIPOC-led worker self-directed abortion clinic in the country. We use democratic governance and decision-making systems that provide team members with a voice in the direction of the organization. We expect that full time team members participate in decision-making and continuous improvement initiatives that affect the entire organization. Our vision is to change the landscape of abortion provision through holistic, collaborative,
survivor-centered care. We seek team members who are compassionate, committed to abortion care through all-trimesters, and excited to join a start up healthcare clinic that is shifting the landscape and work structure of abortion provision and training.
