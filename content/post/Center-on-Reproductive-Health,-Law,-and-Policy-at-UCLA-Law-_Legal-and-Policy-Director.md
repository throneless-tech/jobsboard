This work includes: writing amicus briefs; providing technical assistance, conducting legal analysis, and helping develop new legal theories and policies for advocates, policymakers, and health care providers; convening people for strategic and practical solutions to legal and policy problems; conducting and supporting original research and writing about legal and policy innovation, models, and best practices; and helping enhance strategic connection between researchers and advocates and maximizing impact of research on policy and litigation.
