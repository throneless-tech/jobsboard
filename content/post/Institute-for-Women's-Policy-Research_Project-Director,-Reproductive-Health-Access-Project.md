The Project Director will lead Connect for Success, a four-year initiative that aims to resource, document, and expand programs to connect community college students with high-quality reproductive health services, information, and resources. The purpose of this project is to increase the number of community colleges fostering these connections for their students; students accessing the resources they need; policymakers at multiple levels prioritizing these efforts; and funders supporting them.
