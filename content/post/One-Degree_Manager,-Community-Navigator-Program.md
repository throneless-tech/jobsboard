We are looking for a Manager of the Community Navigator Program (CNP) to join our team of 16 One Degree team members and dozens of remote part-time employees and volunteers.  The Community Navigator Program is a small and mighty team that empowers over 35,000 resource-seekers and service providers with One Degree through community outreach, virtual engagement and relationship building. The Manager will provide strategic and practical guidance in community outreach, mentorship and performance management with a racial and class equity lens. As we grow, this role will be responsible for supporting areas with trainings that do not yet have a dedicated Community Navigator, as well as hiring and training new roles.
