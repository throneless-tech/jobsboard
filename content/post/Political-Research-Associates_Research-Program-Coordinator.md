Political Research Associates (PRA) is a national nonprofit devoted to supporting movements that are building a more just and inclusive democratic society. We provide research, strategy, and briefings to expose movements, institutions, and ideologies that undermine human rights. PRA publishes The Public Eye magazine quarterly.

The core responsibilities of the Research Program Coordinator are in four categories: (1) facilitating project management, (2) administrative coordination, (3) maintaining research program archives and records, and (4) research support.
