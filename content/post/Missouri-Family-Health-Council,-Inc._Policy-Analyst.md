As a member of the External Affairs team, the Policy Analyst is responsible for research, analysis, and written work product to increase the success of our shared policy agenda, while helping build and promote MFHC’s brand and health center network as the state’s reproductive and sexual health experts. This position is mainly micro-level focused with input on the macro-level, and is responsible for the execution of projects and work products, grant compliance, and contributing to a more equitable and inclusive organization. If you’re as energized about policymaking, analysis, and writing as you are about making a true impact in the field of sexual and reproductive healthcare at its most critical time, we want to hear from you.
