The Development & Database Associate is responsible for the accurate, efficient entry and maintenance of MSI United Statesâ€™ donor data as an integral member of the development team. In addition to gift processing and database administration, this position serves as a bridge between our Development, Finance, and Marketing & Communications teams by providing critical support for donor relations, financial reconciliation, and our direct mail program. This role joins a data-driven team with a donor-centric stewardship culture, and the ideal candidate will enjoy being an early-knower about new available tools to drive efficiencies and improve data systems and will communicate with supporters in equal measure. For many of our individual donors, the Development & Database Associate is the frontline face and voice of our organization.  

The Development & Database Associate also provides office management support and has responsibility for answering our office telephone line, managing our general office email inboxes and collecting mail from our DC post office box. The Development & Database Associate reports to the Development Officer. This role is based out of our Washington, DC office, with the possibility of some remote work.
