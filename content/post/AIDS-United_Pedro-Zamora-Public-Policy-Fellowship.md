The Pedro Zamora Public Policy Fellowship at AIDS United was established to honor the legacy of HIV/AIDS activist Pedro Zamora. Zamora, one of the first openly gay men with HIV to appear in popular television, who passed away in 1994 shortly after appearing on MTVâ€™s The Real World: San Francisco. As a house guest, he educated a generation of viewers about living with HIV/AIDS and provided an unprecedented view into his life for millions. Zamora was a passionate advocate for federal HIV prevention and care programs and encouraged young people to become actively involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Zamora even served on the Board of Directors for AIDS Action before it merged with the National AIDS Fund to form AIDS United. It is in his spirit that the Pedro Zamora Public Policy Fellowship offers opportunities to advance and empower a new generation of advocates. The Pedro Zamora Public Policy Fellowship prepares current students or recent graduates for a lifetime of social justice advocacy. Working closely with the AIDS United Policy Department, Zamora Fellows gain a professional understanding of HIV, advocacy, and public policy and practical advocacy experience in a supported environment.
