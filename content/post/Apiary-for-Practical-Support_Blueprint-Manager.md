The Blueprint Manager is a brand new role that will hold primary responsibility for the creation, management, and implementation of our Practical Support Blueprint program – a consolidated training model to support existing groups and help new groups in providing practical support services to their clients. The information gathering portion of this project is mostly done and we have begun building materials, but we are now hiring someone to take this and run with it – to finish synthesizing what we learned into one comprehensive model of service provision, create a formal system for training groups on how to offer practical support, and then provide the actual training and in-depth support organizations and groups need to start serving clients.

*Note: additional benefits include reimbursement for ACA plan coverage and flexible work schedule.
