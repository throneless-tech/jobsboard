The successful candidate will be a proven leader, a visionary and strategic thinker, a strong policy advocate, an innovator and a compelling communicator, who nurtures and thrives in a collaborative environment. They will have a thorough knowledge of economic and social rights and of the broader political systems, economic and climate justice movements and struggles that shape the concrete ways in which those rights are understood, contested, and can be used as drivers of systemic change. They will have the foresight, skills, political judgement, networks and connections to lead CESR’s continued growth to become a leading policy advocate and thought leader with visible and effective presence in different geographies, policy spaces and programmatic areas. They will also efficiently and accountably oversee the organization’s operations, development and finance.
