Fellows will work with Campus Organizers to build a movement on campus to mobilize students for Wisconsinâ€™s 2024 elections. This is an excellent opportunity to get an inside look at how political campaigns work, while contributing to critical elections in 2024. 

The spring cohort will start in March and work through the end of the spring semester, the fall cohort will start in mid-July and work through November. Fellows will spend 15 hours a week mobilizing on their campus by doing everything from leading events and volunteer recruitment to talking to students about the importance of the upcoming elections for issues like reproductive rights, climate change, democracy, and economic justice. Tactics include high traffic canvassing, tabling, door-to-door canvassing, class/student organization visits, and text/phone/DM banks. This is a paid fellowship.
