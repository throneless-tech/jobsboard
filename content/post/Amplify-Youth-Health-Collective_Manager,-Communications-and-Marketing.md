Amplify is looking for a compelling storyteller who will increase community awareness about the importance of youth sexual health and well-being; amplify the urgency to address sexual health inequities that exist for marginalized young people; and highlight the work of our partner network. The Communications and Marketing Manager must be creative, innovative, experienced, and enjoy working within a small, entrepreneurial, mission-focused, and community-oriented environment.
