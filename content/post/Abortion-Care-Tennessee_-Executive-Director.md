The Executive Director of ACT is responsible for overseeing and managing the organizationâ€™s operations, programs, and strategic direction in collaboration with the Board of Directors and the Director of Development & Operations.
ACT funds procedural costs for Tennesseans traveling to access abortion. We provide block grants to our partner clinics, who distribute the funds to patients. ACT is unapologetically pro-abortion. We believe in everyone's right to access the care they need, when and where they need it. We believe that our community is strong and together we can support the most vulnerable Tennesseans in their search for abortion care. We celebrate bodily autonomy, and the joy of helping each other access our rights. This position is full time at 32 hours per week and is remote, but the ED must live in Tennessee. A relocation stipend is available, and ACT would like the ED to start in June of 2024, and live in the state by October of 2024.
