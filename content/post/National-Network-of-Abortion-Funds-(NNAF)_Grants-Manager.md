The Grants Manager is responsible for ensuring the grants management and award processes are operating smoothly and meeting the needs of all parties. The Grants Manager is part of the Grants team in the Technical Assistance Department, which supports abortion funds in building up their programmatic and operations infrastructure.The Grants Manager works primarily with the Grants Coordinator, and in close coordination with Operations, Finance, and Development teams, as well as with grantees. They take a lead role in project managing disbursements and related reporting, and working with other departments to understand and document processes, regulations, and guidelines that affect grantmaking and contracts. The Grants Manager is committed to bringing accessibility and a racial, economic, and reproductive justice lens to traditional philanthropic competencies.

NNAF is newly formalizing its role as a funding intermediary and grantmaker, using the Outbound Funds module of Salesforce to track grant disbursements. NNAF anticipates that the Grants Manager will play a role in assessing current tools and informing systems updates with feedback from the abortion fund network.
