The Legal Aid Justice Center is a dynamic racial justice organization, whose budget and staff has doubled in recent years and whose programs continue to expand in complexity, impact, and reach. LAJC is seeking a Deputy Director of Operations (DDO) to help shape and support the growth of the organization. Working in close partnership with our Executive Director, Deputy Director of Advocacy, and senior leadership team, the DDO will design and build systems to provide infrastructure and support to our advocates in achieving an ambitious community-driven agenda in pursuit of racial, economic, and social justice.
