We are seeking Press Directors and Deputy Press Directors through the November 5 election to support Democratic candidates running for state legislative seats in Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, or Pennsylvania. Each Director will lead and support communications efforts for their caucus and manage a team of earned media specialists who each support earned media for multiple candidates. This role serves as a messaging resource for caucus stakeholders and battleground candidates, aiding them in developing messaging on their issues for public communications. The Director will ensure earned media outreach for targeted candidates is aligned with best practices for state legislative races and liaise between stakeholders to ensure communications efforts are strategic and effective.
