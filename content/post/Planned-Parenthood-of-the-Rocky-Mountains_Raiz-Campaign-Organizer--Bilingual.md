​​Your days will be a mix of in-person and remote work. You will spend your time attending in-person community events, coalition-building, having one on one meetings with potential volunteer activists, planning virtual and in-person educational and engagement events, tracking your efforts in our database, and supporting our coalition partners in their community efforts. You will travel within your state and within our four-state affiliate region occasionally.  You will manage your work hours to include some evenings and weekends.  
​ 
​Although we are a health care provider and not a Reproductive Justice organization, we support and ally ourselves with our partners in the Reproductive Justice movement. Reproductive Justice is intersectional and includes immigration work, LGBTQ+ justice, and black liberation. We are an intersectional organization and support our partners, so you should expect your work to be intersectional as well.
