We are currently seeking Planned Parenthood Advocates of Wisconsin Campus and Community Organizers to engage and expand awareness of reproductive rights access and threats specifically within the state legislatures through online actions, voter outreach, and relationship building. As a campus and community organizer, you would work closely with the organizing team to support the development of grassroots and grasstops relationships on college campuses and local communities, and recruit and train dozens of volunteers committed to defending reproductive freedom. Over the summer, the organizers will work with volunteer leaders to launch a summer training program dedicated to relational organizing before heading into the fall. Your role as a community organizer will be to support recruitment, promotion and tracking of that work. Come August, organizers and their volunteers will leverage their relationships and mobilize their community to launch a voter identification and Get Out The Vote operation through Election Day 2024 â€“ work which the organizer will be promoting by using voter identification systems and relational organizing tools, as well as the recruitment and training of volunteers to engage in GOTV activities.
