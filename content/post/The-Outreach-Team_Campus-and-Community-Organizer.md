Campus and Community Organizers will be charged with recruiting, training, and working with a team of volunteers on college campuses and their local communities and build support for permanently ending the Global Gag Rule. This work will lead into a series of summer summits to train local leaders who will fight for global reproductive freedom. In the fall, Organizers will transition to overseeing non-partisan paid canvass operations to educate and turn out young voters in the 2024 General Election.
