Gain valuable political experience and help elect Democratic pro-choice women up and down the ticket! We offer internships during the spring, summer, and fall semesters in all of our departments. Interns have the opportunity to do substantive work, while gaining in-depth experience in the political sector. In addition to daily work in their departments and attendance at staff events, interns participate in brown bag sessions, which gives them the opportunity to hear from varying levels of staff while learning about their professional history and gaining deeper knowledge about how all the departments at EMILY’s List work. Our interns leave EMILY’s List ready for life on the campaign trail after attending our signature IGNITE Change training that will equip each intern with skills for beginning a career in campaigns.
