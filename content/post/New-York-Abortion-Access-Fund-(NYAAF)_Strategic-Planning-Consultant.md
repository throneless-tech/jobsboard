NYAAF seeks to contract with a consultant who, in collaboration with an internal strategic planning committee made up of the Board of Directors and select staff, will lead the organization in drafting a multi-year strategic plan. 
It is particularly important to us that the time invested in this strategic planning process serves the organization as it continues to grow and that the process is forward-thinking and actionable.
