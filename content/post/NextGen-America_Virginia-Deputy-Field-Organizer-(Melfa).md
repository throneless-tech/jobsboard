Virginia Deputy Field Organizer (Melfa):



THE ROLE: 

NextGen America is seeking passionate and hardworking candidates to join our youth organizing program in Virginia, working to engage young people in electoral politics by registering thousands of young people to vote across the state.

Our work will engage young people in voter registration efforts, volunteer recruitment, and pledging young people to vote. Organizers need to be comfortable and confident in: speaking with students and canvassing in public, mobilizing their own community, growing their network to include new volunteers to train, and motivating community leaders to help register and mobilize their own networks. Organizers are directly responsible for hitting weekly and phase metric goals.
