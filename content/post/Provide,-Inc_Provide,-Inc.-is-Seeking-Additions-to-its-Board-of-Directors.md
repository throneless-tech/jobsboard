Provide is looking for self-directed thought partners to join our Board of Directors (volunteer position). We seek individuals who can contribute to strategic thought direction in partnership with current Board members and who can support the Provide staff. Our ideal candidates will be committed to protecting reproductive autonomy for all people, including safe access to abortion, especially those from vulnerable populations while understanding how systemic racism plays a role in how folks experience healthcare across the country. We are particularly seeking professionals who possess substantial experience, particularly those with a legal background and expertise, as well as professionals with a skillset centered in the realm of external communications. People of color, women, LGBQIA+, Trans and Nonbinary people, and those with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply. 
The Provide Board meets in person twice per year with no out-of-pocket expenses for Board members. Prospective Board members must also commit to quarterly virtual committee or working group meetings and to making an annual financial contribution.
