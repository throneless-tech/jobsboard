Founded in 1992, Provide is a national organization that works to ensure access to abortion, historically for those living in rural communities and in Southern and Midwestern states. 

Provide is looking for self-directed thought partners to join our Board of Directors (a volunteer position). We seek individuals who can contribute to strategic thought direction in partnership with current Board members and who can support the Provide staff. Our ideal candidates will be committed to protecting reproductive autonomy for all people, including safe access to abortion, especially those from vulnerable populations while understanding how systemic racism plays a role in how folks experience healthcare across the country. 

People of color, women, LGBQIA+, Trans and Nonbinary people, and those with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.  

The Provide Board meets in person twice per year with no out-of-pocket expenses for Board members. Prospective Board members must also commit to quarterly virtual committee or working group meetings and to making an annual financial contribution within their means.  

If interested, please follow our application link to submit your resume and a cover letter telling us more about you and what interests you in this Board position.
