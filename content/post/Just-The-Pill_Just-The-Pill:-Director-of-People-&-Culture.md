Just The Pill is seeking a full-time Director of People and Culture to lead the charge in building our foundational culture, processes, and procedures around Human Resources from the ground up. Reproductive care has been made unnecessarily stressful in America, and our new Director of People and Culture will be here to support our frontline staff and clinicians who make it as smooth and comfortable as possible. Our team was started by abortion workers, and we value the complex emotional work involved in helping patients navigate harmful laws. In this role, you will implement practices to support our staff and maintain a work culture that promotes self-care. Our ideal candidate has a deep commitment to reproductive justice and experience in Human Resources and Operational support and has the experience and direction to build this role, as our organization is in its start-up phase and requires strong support.
