The Women, Peace and Security Analyst reports to and works with the Senior Program and Research Manager (SPRM) to analyze the work of the UN Security Council to support broader advocacy efforts of the NGO Working Group (“NGOWG”) on Women, Peace and Security (“WPS”).  The work of the Analyst will primarily contribute to analysis and research that is published in various formats that will examine the way in which the UN Security Council and the UN system are meeting women, peace and security obligations, notably those related to women’s rights in crisis and conflict-affected settings, and ensuring women’s full, equal, and meaningful participation in peace and political processes. This position is ideal for an individual with knowledge of women, peace and security, experience in qualitative data analysis, specifically content and/or discourse analysis, and a desire to contribute meaningfully to efforts to hold stakeholders responsible for protecting women’s human rights.
