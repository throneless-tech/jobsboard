The Organizing Intern will assist in supporting the growth and development of the Youth Activist Alliances in Alabama, Minnesota, Nevada, and Texas. They will also support the planning and outreach of the Youth Activist Alliances Summit, an Organizing 101 training led by Alliance leaders to intentionally recruit and develop leadership capacity in each Alliance state. 

Youth Activist Alliance Leaders are youth organizers who run local or state-level grassroots campaigns for change in youth sexual health and rights and reproductive justice in Alabama, Minnesota, Nevada, and Texas. By co-creating bold visions in the fight for a world free from oppression, each alliance will launch their own campaign for change targeting their county and city councils, school boards, and state legislatures, and build up a powerful base of young activists committed to the movement for reproductive justice.
