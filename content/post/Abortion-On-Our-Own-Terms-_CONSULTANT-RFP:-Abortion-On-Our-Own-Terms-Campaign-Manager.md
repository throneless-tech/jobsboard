A project of the New Venture Fund is seeking an individual consultant or team to serve as Campaign Manager for Abortion On Our Own Terms (AOOOT) – a narrative and culture change campaign to promote self-managed abortion as an option that should be accessible for anyone who chooses it. The consultant will initially be responsible for overseeing the campaign’s public launch in April 2022 and implementing the plan developed by the Campaign Steering Committee (comprised of six leading reproductive health, rights, and justice organizations, with support from communications consultants), and will then continue to develop the campaign plan moving forward. The campaign will include coordinated national and state efforts targeting changemakers, in particular allied progressive organizations, state and national policymakers, and progressive influencers, by developing and implementing outreach strategies for media, partners, supporters, and other audiences. The consultant will report to the Steering Committee, as well as work with committee leads, consultants, and coalition members.
