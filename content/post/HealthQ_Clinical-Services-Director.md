 The Clinical Services Director will ensure that we exceed expectations, identify and remove barriers, and maintain quality standards. Accountable for ensuring compliance with regulatory and accreditation requirements, overseeing programs and clinical operations, providing leadership for staff, and ensuring the delivery of high quality, evidence-based, compassionate, patient-centered healthcare, the Clinical Services Director will work primarily administratively, yet with an expectation to provide direct patient care when it will benefit the mission.
