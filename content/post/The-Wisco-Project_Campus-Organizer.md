Campus organizers will work on key campuses across Wisconsin to build organizations that engage students, provide value to young people, mobilize voters for the spring elections, and prepare systems for key 2024 races. We will start hiring our first wave ASAP, with additional hiring opportunities through November 2024. This position will be based at one of Wisconsinâ€™s universities and requires a significant amount of in-person work.  This is not a conventional organizing position. You will be asked to think outside the box, and be gritty-as-hell to build a startup that empowers young people for many elections to come.
