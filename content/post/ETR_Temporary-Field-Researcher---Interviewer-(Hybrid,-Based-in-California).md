Under the supervision of an Evaluator/Project Coordinator/Data Manager, the Field Researcher (Interviewer) will coordinate with the team to schedule or attend data collection times, collect survey data on tablets or via the phone from homeless youth, enter tracking data (participant contact information, study status information, status updates, etc.) into an online program, perform other data tasks as assigned, and keep careful documentation about these activities. The ideal candidate will be familiar with the research process, including following data collection protocols, using tablets for data collection, and documenting activities. The majority of the activities will take place on an unpredictable schedule based on the needs of the young mothers and will include mornings, afternoons, evenings and weekends. This is a hybrid position and will require travel in/around Los Angeles County and San Diego County.
