Our Justice is seeking a full-time, salaried Communications Manager to tell the story of our organization - our work, our history, our values - to our key audiences in a new, consistent, and engaging way. In this role, you can collaborate with our small team and volunteers to help this organization of over 50 years deepen community understanding of reproductive justice, educate and activate folks around our work to remove Minnesotaâ€™s unconstitutional anti-abortion restrictions, help Our Justice show up for our partners, and strengthen relationships with our community allies and supporters.
