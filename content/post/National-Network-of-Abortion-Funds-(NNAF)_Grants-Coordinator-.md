The Grants Coordinator supports the grants management and award processes to ensure that they are operating smoothly and meeting the needs of all parties. The Grants Coordinator is part of the Grants team in the Technical Assistance (TA) Department, which supports abortion funds in building up their programmatic and operations infrastructure. The Grants Coordinator works primarily with the Grants Manager, and in close coordination with Operations, Finance, and Development teams, as well as with grantees. They support logistics and administration of grant disbursements and related reporting, and maintain accurate records for greater programmatic and financial transparency with member funds. The Grants Coordinator is committed to bringing accessibility and a racial, economic, and reproductive justice lens to traditional philanthropic competencies.

NNAF is newly formalizing its role as a funding intermediary and grantmaker, using the Outbound Funds module of Salesforce to track grant disbursements. NNAF anticipates that the Grants Manager will play a role in assessing current tools and informing systems updates with feedback from the abortion fund network.
