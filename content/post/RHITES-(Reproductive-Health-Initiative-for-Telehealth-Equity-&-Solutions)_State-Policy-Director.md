RHITES (Reproductive Health Initiative for Telehealth Equity & Solutions) is focused on building partnerships and lifting the equity impacts of policy on the delivery of telehealth for reproductive health care, with an emphasis on abortion care.  RHITES focuses its work with both the sexual and reproductive health, rights, and SRH, rights, and justice spaces and telehealth/innovation industry landscape. The State Policy Director (SPD) will play a critical role in tracking and analyzing state policy and regulations relevant to the provision or accessibility of medication abortion care via telehealth and developing key relationships to educate on the equity impacts. The SPD will also take a leading role in developing written and oral analysis with top advisers and peers in the reproductive health, rights, and justice communities as well as the telehealth and innovation spaces. Specifically, the SPD will perform state analysis with an eye to service provision of telehealth for medication abortion care, ensuring the work is up to date related to any legislation, regulations, or policy guidance that may change these analyses.
