TLDEF seeks a motivated Major Gifts Officer who is eager to join a high growth organization at a critical time for transgender rights. In less than three years, TLDEF’s annual budget has more than doubled in size from $831K to $2M+ as a direct result of the Executive Director’s plan to scale our organization to meet the many challenges and opportunities that face our movement. The Major Gifts Officer will join a growing Development Department to build and sustain giving among TLDEF’s major donors who give $1,000 or more annually.
