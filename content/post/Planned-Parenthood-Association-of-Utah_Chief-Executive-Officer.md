Planned Parenthood Association of Utah is seeking a new President/CEO to provide vision, leadership, and management, to lead an organization that advocates for reproductive health access and education. The organization is at a pivotal moment, having to navigate increasing legislative restrictions and challenges (many of which are byproducts of the overturning of the Supreme Court case Roe v Wade) as well as trying to expand its reach to underserved and increasingly diverse communities across the state. The President/CEO will champion state efforts to advance healthcare access and education by navigating legislative challenges and fighting for laws and policies to protect reproductive rights. The ideal candidate will work closely with senior staff members and clinic leaders to ensure seamless coordination and the delivery of high-quality healthcare service and education in the communities in Utah.
