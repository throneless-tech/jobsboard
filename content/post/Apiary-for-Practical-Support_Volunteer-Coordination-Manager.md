This a brand new role for a new program we are launching - a centralized system for training potential volunteers on behalf of practical support organizations across the country. This person will be responsible for building this program from the ground up and then leading its implementation. This includes: building a process for tracking and managing all internal and external data, ensuring all potential volunteers are vetted, trained, and sent back to the relevant practical support group, creating trainings and any relevant materials, identifying ways to improve or expand existing materials, collaborating with other trainers to supplement or consolidate efforts, and any other duties that may interact with volunteer management.

*Note: additional benefits include reimbursement for ACA plan coverage and flexible working schedule.
