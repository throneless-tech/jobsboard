The Research Scientist II (RS II) plans, organizes, and directs scientific research studies of a moderate scope and complexity related to equitable access to sexual and reproductive health focused on identifying and reducing barriers to abortion care faced by vulnerable Californians. The incumbent works as a member of a multi-disciplinary team with OHEâ€™s Gender Health Equity Section, leading and overseeing the design and implementation of research grant funding and evaluation for a complex statewide grant program. The RS II will have the responsibility to make independent, difficult decisions related to the design, implementation, analyses, and conclusions drawn from funded research and/or evaluation studies.

The RS II is responsible for co-authoring reports requiring interpretation and clear summarization of results of complex program evaluation, the results of which would be used in developing new effective public health prevention programs focused on improving access to sexual and reproductive health care in California.
