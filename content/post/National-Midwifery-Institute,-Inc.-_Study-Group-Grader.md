Position: Coursework Instructor
Primary Responsibility: Review, give feedback, and grade studentsâ€™ coursework.
Position Description:
National Midwifery Institute utilizes a correspondence model for Direct Entry Midwifery Education. Students complete module based coursework, and submit their responses to a series of short answer, long answer, and essay questions, in addition to project assignments. These are submitted via email to our Coursework Instructor pool. Instructors then grade student work according to a rubric, provide feedback, and in some cases correspond directly with students to support their growth and learning. We have one senior instructor, and are seeking to develop a pool of instructors. Hours are variable and based on Contractor availability and student demand.
