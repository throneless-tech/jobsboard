The Program Coordinator will be jointly responsible for ensuring the effective and efficient administration of Fund Texas Choiceâ€™s trip planning program in alignment with reproductive justice values. The program coordinator will help guide callers seeking out of state practical support through the abortion care system and will work to overcome obstacles faced by the client receiving the care and services they require. This entails working with callers directly to support their travel needs for out-of-state appointments, maintaining relationships with abortion clinics, other abortion funds, and practical support networks nationwide, knowing how and when to refer clients to the right spaces, and assisting with administrative tasks related to direct caller engagement and funding.
