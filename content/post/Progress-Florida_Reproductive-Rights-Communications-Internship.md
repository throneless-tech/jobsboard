**Students of Eckerd College & University of South Florida: St. Pete only please** 

10 hours/week, remote & 1 in-person day a week in St. Pete.

Interns will gain knowledge on running digital campaigns related to social justice issues; historical and current issues in the reproductive rights, health, and justice movement; persuasive and motivational writing techniques; media relations; graphic design; current news; and political advocacy.  A variety of work-learning opportunities will be offered. For example, Progress Florida and FRF run several social media accounts on platforms that include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. Our interns are part of a creative team producing content for these platforms related to current issues in reproductive health and rights, including abortion access.
