The National Director of Expansion will lead Upstream’s efforts to develop partnerships with key stakeholders in states/markets where the organization has yet to develop a significant programmatic footprint. The National Director will set proactive strategies for stakeholder engagement in new states/markets and oversee a talented Expansion Team to develop and formalize partnerships that position Upstream for impact at scale. Specifically, the National Director and their team will cultivate relationships with state and local government officials, state-wide and place-based networks and associations, and influential healthcare leaders to drive deeper adoption of our mission and program. The National Director will take on a key leadership role within Upstream’s Growth function and report to the Vice President of Growth, Strategy, and Partnership Success. They will be an effective strategist, savvy relationship builder, and strong people manager who draws energy from launching new initiatives and exploring uncharted pathways to impact and growth.
