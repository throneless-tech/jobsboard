Specifically, the National Director and their team will cultivate relationships with state and local government officials, state-wide and place-based networks and associations, and influential healthcare leaders to drive deeper adoption of our mission and program. The National Director will take on a key leadership role within Upstream’s Growth function and report to the Vice President of Growth, Strategy, and Partnership Success. They will be an effective strategist, savvy relationship builder, and strong people manager who draws energy from launching new initiatives and exploring uncharted pathways to impact and growth.
