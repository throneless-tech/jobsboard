The National Employment Law Project (NELP) seeks a dynamic, experienced, and skilled person to join our Work Structures team as a Senior Policy Analyst or Senior Staff Attorney to advance NELP’s programs and policy campaigns. You will join a team of experts who are working with partners to (1) combat anti-worker corporate labor contracting practices, like the misuse of temporary help and staffing agencies and the misclassification of employees as independent contractors, which erode employer accountability, job quality, and worker power, and (2) devise and advance pro-worker policies that ensure employer accountability, expand workers’ access to rights, and build worker power and fundamental rights. This is an extraordinary opportunity to leverage your talent and join a team that ensures progressive and impactful worker-driven policies are at the forefront of current and future worker rights in the U.S. labor market.
