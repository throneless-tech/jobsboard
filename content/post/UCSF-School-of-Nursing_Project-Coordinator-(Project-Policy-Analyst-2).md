The Project Coordinator will work closely with the Principal Investigator, Co-Principal Investigator, and Project Director to develop and maintain study, project, and administrative systems and relationships. This position will primarily support the Abortion Care Training Incubator for Outstanding Nurse Scholars (ACTIONS) Program's role leading the development of reproductive justice curricula and evaluation of the new California Reproductive Health Service Corps.

They will be responsible for administrative coordination and logistical event coordination for the PIs and other members of the team. They will maintain relationships with project partners and vendors; development and maintain data collection systems, protocols and instruments; prepare manuscripts for publication, gather and assemble analytical and factual data; and prepare preliminary outlines for the conduct of analysis and accomplishment of assigned tasks and objectives. The Project Coordinator will work on research data and project reporting assignments that are of moderate complexity. They will exercise judgment within generally defined practices and policies in selecting methods and techniques for obtaining solutions. As this project and research focuses on sensitive topics such as abortion training and provision, comfort discussing those issues and interacting in a positive and sensitive manner with individuals providing reproductive health care services is essential.
