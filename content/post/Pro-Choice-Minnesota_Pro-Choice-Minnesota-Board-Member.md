Pro-Choice Minnesota’s mission is to build collective power to remove barriers, strengthe protections, and expand access to abortion and all reproductive healthcare in Minnesota. We believe that every person has the right to make choices about their body’s reproduction, and we apply an intersectional and reproductive justice lens to our work.


The fight to maintain and expand reproductive freedom in Minnesota is more important than ever–people from the Upper Midwest are seeking abortion care in Minnesota because there is no longer a federal constitutional right to abortion. Through its electoral, legislative, and educational work, the Pro-Choice Minnesota Board of Directors is dedicated to keeping Minnesota as a safe haven for abortion rights in the upper Midwest.


Interested applicants should complete a Nominee Application packet, available by emailing info@prochoiceminnesota.org. Completed applications are due to Pro-Choice Minnesota Board Member Rachel Engstrom (Governance@prochoiceminnesota.org) by the close of business October 31, 2023. Completed applications will be reviewed by the Board of Directors based on applicant qualifications and current Board needs.


Pro-Choice Minnesota Board of Directors members commit to two-year terms, with terms beginning in January of each year. We are committed to creating and expanding reproductive freedom for all. Having representation from all communities on our board, particularly from BIPOC and queer communities that are disproportionally impacted by limited reproductive freedoms, is an important way to help us grow in diversity, equity, and inclusion. BIPOC and LGBTQ+ community members are encouraged to apply.
