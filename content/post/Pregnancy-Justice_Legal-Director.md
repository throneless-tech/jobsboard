Pregnancy Justice seeks a Legal Director to shape its legal strategy at a pivotal moment in the reproductive justice movement and for the organization. With Lourdes Rivera joining Pregnancy Justice as its new President in September 2023, the Legal Director will work in partnership to help develop the vision for Pregnancy Justice's legal strategy, which includes: impactful criminal defense representation, criminal justice reform, affirmative civil rights litigation, policy advocacy, education and training, and research. The Legal Director will supervise the day-to-day operations of the legal team and its staff, ensure professional development and growth opportunities, work in close collaboration with the communications and development teams, and will be a member of the senior leadership team. The Legal Director will be instrumental in developing a long-term vision to not only defend individual rights, but also position Pregnancy Justice to be an influential changemaker of constitutional and statutory law at the state and federal levels. The ideal candidate will be a seasoned litigator with a civil rights practice, experience or familiarity with criminal defense, and demonstrated experience integrating legal strategy across the state or federal space. They will be an excellent people manager to effectively lead a team of attorneys, fellows, and program staff in research and policy.
