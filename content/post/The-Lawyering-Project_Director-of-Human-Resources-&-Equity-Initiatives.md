The Lawyering Project is planning to leave fiscal sponsorship in the upcoming year and become an independent, 501(c)(3) organization.  We are seeking a Director of Human Resources & Equity Initiatives to help guide the organization through this transition and manage the Lawyering Project’s human resources operations going forward. In addition, the Director of Human Resources & Equity Initiatives will be responsible for developing and implementing human resources strategies, policies, and systems; providing guidance to the executive team on human resources and equity issues; and upholding the Lawyering Project’s commitment to building a workplace culture centered on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).
