First Shift's Medical Legal Partnership Advocate will train medical providers and staff at health care facilities in Washington D.C. about their patients' workplace rights to reasonable accommodations, leave from work, and paid family leave benefits, with the objective of equipping them to better support their low-income patients' exercise of these rights. The Medical Legal Partnership Advocate will also provide technical assistance to medical providers; develop online resources and tools for medical providers regarding workplace rights; and work with First Shift's Community Engagement Manager to conduct outreach to local health care facilities. JD or  MPH preferred.
