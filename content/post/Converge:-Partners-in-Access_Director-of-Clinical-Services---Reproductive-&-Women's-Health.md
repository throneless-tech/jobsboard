Converge: Partners in Access is dedicated to ensuring all people can access high quality reproductive and sexual health care when they need it, how they need it and where they live. In 2023, Converge launched Get Personal â€“ a platform for free telehealth direct-to-patient clinical care -- with longer term goals to offer an in-person clinic for Mississippians. At this moment of exciting growth, the Director of Clinical Services will champion the full implementation and ongoing management of these new service offerings. Reporting to the Vice President of Programs, this position calls for an experienced leader in health clinic management who is energized to build something from the ground up.
