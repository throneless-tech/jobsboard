If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice transforms the law and policy landscape through advocacy, support, and organizing so all people have the power to determine if, when, and how to define, create, and sustain families with dignity, and to actualize sexual and reproductive wellbeing on their own terms. To foster that vision and continue our track record, If/When/How is embracing a co-leadership model to guide its next era of work. With a dedicated staff who are experts in their fields, a committed and nimble Board of Directors, and an annual budget of $19 million, If/When/How is poised to continue its groundbreaking work and bring to life our new strategic plan to get to our 10-year goal:  a future where people in every state will have more power to determine their reproductive lives in safety and with dignity, shielded from criminalization and state control over their experiences and decisions about their bodies and families.
