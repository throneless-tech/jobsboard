The Patient Services Assistant (PSA) is responsible for carrying out a variety of administrative duties essential to daily clinic operation. Primary responsibilities include reception duties (check-in, insurance verification, collecting payments), scheduling appointments, updating patient information in the Electronic Health Record, and following up on patient referrals. As the first point of contact for many of our patients, visitors and members of the community, the PSA consistently provides friendly, compassionate customer service.
