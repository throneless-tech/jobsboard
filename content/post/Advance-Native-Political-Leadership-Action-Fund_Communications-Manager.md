Advance Native Political Leadership Action Fund is looking for a Communications Manager to join our growing team. We are looking for somebody interested in moving beyond cookie cutter communications, press, and social media strategies as they have traditionally been done; someone who enjoys setting the curve rather than following it. This role is right for someone with a passion for creating accessible content around the issues impacting Indian Country, and who is skilled at deconstructing complex narratives. If you have experience developing communication strategies that bring forward the arcs of our ancestors to build power for future generations, this position might be for you.
