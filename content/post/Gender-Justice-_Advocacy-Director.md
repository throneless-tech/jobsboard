The Advocacy Director will provide the vision and direction for our policy and legislative advocacy, movement-building, civic engagement, and political and electoral programming. As a member of the leadership team, the Advocacy Director also works closely in partnership with the Executive Director to provide vision and leadership for the organization overall. The Director will work to advance gender justice through policymaker education, legislative policy development and lobbying, development of strategic partnerships, coalition-building, and administrative advocacy. Priority issue areas include reproductive rights and justice, including abortion access and maternal health, LGBQ rights, transgender rights, womenâ€™s rights, and gender-based violence and harassment. The Director oversees the strategy and execution of advocacy, political and organizing programming, as well as manages a team of 4-6+ people and works in close partnership with the Political Director and North Dakota State Director, who each hold significant leadership over their intersecting areas of work. The Director will coach internal staff and external stakeholders, serving as an advocate and organizer and motivating staff and stakeholders to understand their power, realize common goals, and shepherd bold policy agendas to advance gender equity. The Director also serves as a passionate and visible spokesperson and as a prominent leader throughout the organization, at the Capitol, among stakeholders, in the community, and nationally where appropriate.
