The Finance and Operations Director is a new role for our rapidly expanding organization which has grown from a staff of 2 in January 2021 to a staff of 8 in October 2022. And our team will likely continue to grow to meet the growing abortion access needs in California and throughout the country. This position will work to further ACCESS’ mission, vision and values by leading the day-to-day financial management of the organization, managing and further developing our human resources and benefits programs, and supporting the organization’s various operations activities. The Finance and Operations Director will take on the task of further building out the organization’s  finance and operations systems and procedures for the long-term sustainability of the organization.  This position will supervise the Operations and Administrative Coordinator and work collaboratively with all members of the Staff, Board, as well as various consultants. This role would be ideal for a systems thinker who is excited about the prospect of building scalable systems with values alignment at the center.
