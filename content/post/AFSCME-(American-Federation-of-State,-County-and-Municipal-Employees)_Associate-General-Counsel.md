AFSCME is one of the largest, most diverse unions in the country, with 1.4 million members devoted to public service.  The Office of the General Counsel is integral to advancing AFSCME’s mission and is looking for an exceptional attorney to join us in our fight to improve and expand workers’ rights. Our department provides legal representation and advice to the officers and staff of the International Union and to AFSCME councils and locals throughout the nation. We support AFSCME leaders and staff to address a variety of legal issues, which include solving issues arising under state and federal law; providing support to organizing campaigns; supporting political action and legislative programs; providing advice and assistance on internal governance matters and union democracy; and supporting and forwarding litigation. Emphasis is directed at legal issues involving organizing the unorganized and on legal issues of nationwide concern to AFSCME and its members.
