Community Outreach Group is seeking highly motivated candidates to serve as Rapid Response Senior Organizers. You will work in close coordination with Planned Parenthoodâ€™s national campaigns team and deploy to target states to help seize key moments, organize supporters, win state legislative fights, and build power for Planned Parenthood and the reproductive freedom movement. Each Rapid Response Senior Organizer will be assigned to a region of the country and will work with Planned Parenthoods existing infrastructure to develop and execute campaign plans in their assigned states. Rapid Response Senior Organizers will deploy to a single state for a several month assignment, and be responsible for driving the work on the ground in that placement. This is an in-person organizing position.
