We seek a driven and thoughtful leader who excels at building relationships to direct and oversee strategy four in our strategic plan, focused on ensuring clinical care is evidence-informed and person-centered. This role will be focused on overseeing well-established activities (such as the development and dissemination of clinical guidance) and newly-established activities (such as the provision of medical education through the Society Education platform and the Source for Science podcast), as well as developing new work that is responsive to clinical guidance and medical education needs emerging in the evolving legal and healthcare landscape, and responsive to the ongoing need to address systemic racism. This is a remote position and open to candidates living in the US. It is expected persons in this position will travel approximately 20% of the time for meetings with other staff, meetings with partners, and to support our Annual Meeting. This position reports to the Executive Director.
