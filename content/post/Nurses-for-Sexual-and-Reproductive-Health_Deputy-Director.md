NSRH recognizes that the only way to ensure access to comprehensive healthcare for all is to situate SRH within the larger context of systemic injustice and oppression. In order to do this, we must cultivate partnerships and opportunities for collaboration with the organizations working on these issues, particularly those working on reproductive justice, racial justice and LGBTQ+ rights. We also recognize that we must address inequities in the nursing field and SRH sector if we want to achieve quality, compassionate healthcare for all.  To that end, NSRH is working towards equity and diversity at all levels of our organization and operations. The Deputy Director will play a critical role in helping us attain these goals. The Deputy Director is a critical internal leader who is responsible for ensuring that NSRH maintains strong organizational health and has in place effective systems to carry out its mission. As a senior staff member, the Deputy Director will work closely with the Executive Director in providing leadership, culture setting, and overseeing day-to-day functions of the organization.
