Based in Roanoke and the New River Valley area of Virginia, the New River Abortion Access Fund is working to eliminate economic and logistical barriers to abortion access. NRAAF operates a helpline that provides direct financial and practical support (rides, lodging, gas, meals, childcare, etc.) to Southwest Virginians and Appalachians seeking abortion care, as well as anyone traveling to Virginia for an abortion. The Communications & Development Coordinator is responsible for fundraising, donor relations/engagement, and social media management. They will develop and execute an annual fundraising plan and calendar; set annual goals and objectives, ensuring year-on-year growth and the long term financial health of the organization; identify ways to grow revenue, including generating ideas for bringing in new donors, retaining and increasing donations from existing donors, growing the number of monthly sustainers, and re-engaging lapsed donors; help prepare grant proposals and reports; and coordinate multiple fundraising events annually alongside volunteers.
