The Digital Fellows will support the expansion and maintenance of the services finders within Bedsider and on AbortionFinder.org. Specifically, the Fellows will collect and maintain data for the clinic finder database, including researching and tracking clinics that offer birth control and/or abortion care, abortion funds/practical support organizations, and relevant state legislation.
