The Centerâ€™s US Human Rights team is looking for an enthusiastic, resourceful, and highly organized rising 3L intern with a commitment to reproductive rights and reproductive justice issues to engage in a variety of projects related to our work. The internship will provide the successful candidate with experience in researching, analyzing, and developing human rights strategies to advance the full spectrum of reproductive rights in the United States, and will include work focused on maternal health, assisted reproduction, and abortion. The internship is full-time from June to August 2022 and is based in our New York office though it might offer the option to work remotely, depending on the state of COVID restrictions in Summer 2022. Applicants are encouraged to seek outside funding for their internship. If no outside funding is secured, the internship is eligible for a small stipend.
