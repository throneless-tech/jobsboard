The Bilingual Professional Trainer (BPT) is a national trainer and representative of PPLM’s Get Real and Professional Training Institute (“the Institute”). The Institute highlights training and support of sex educators and trainers implementing the nationally renowned, PPLM-authored, evidence-based curricula, Get Real: Comprehensive Sex Education That Works. The Institute also highlights our most popular training, Sexuality Education Cornerstone Seminar (SECS). As a master trainer, the BPT is responsible for solo and co-facilitation of a vast array of professional education opportunities such as webinars, online courses, and half-day, full-day, and multi-day in-person and virtual training opportunities for sex educators nationwide. The BPT will inform and contribute to further expansion of the Institute through curriculum maintenance and development, as well as the development and facilitation of new opportunities on a variety of sexual and reproductive health topics.
