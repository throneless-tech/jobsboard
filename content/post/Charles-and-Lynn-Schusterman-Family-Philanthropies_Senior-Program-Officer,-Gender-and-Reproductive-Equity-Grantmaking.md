The Senior Program Officer (SPO) will serve as the “connective tissue” within the GRE team, and between the GRE team, cross-functional organizational teams and external consultants. Through grantmaking and other support, GRE works to increase women’s and gender-expansive people’s: 1) political power and leadership; 2) knowledge, freedom and power to determine their reproductive lives; 3) economic power; and 4) safety and security from violence. The SPO will hold GRE’s work to intentionally strengthen both our team’s processes and a culture that reflects our values. They will advance GRE’s strategies by ensuring cross-initiative tools and supports – including capacity building and evaluation – are well-conceived, helpful and delivered with both efficiency and care. The SPO will join a team of six, and be based in Schusterman’s Washington, DC or New York, NY office.
