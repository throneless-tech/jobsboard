We seek Co-Director candidates that have a vision for gender justice philanthropy and a deep connection to grassroots organizing with young Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) most directly impacted by and best positioned to end gender oppression. Co-Directors should apply together, as we will not be matching solo candidates. Third Wave Fund is a collaborative organization, so we’re seeking Co-Directors who can balance giving direction to advance our organization’s strategy while also honoring and drawing upon the lived experiences and professional expertise of our staff, Advisory Council, grantees, and other stakeholders. As a by-and-for organization, we encourage applications from members of our communities, particularly those who have held some management responsibilities but are seeking to grow into organizational leadership positions. Third Wave is committed to providing coaching and other professional development support to help the right candidates succeed in their new roles.
