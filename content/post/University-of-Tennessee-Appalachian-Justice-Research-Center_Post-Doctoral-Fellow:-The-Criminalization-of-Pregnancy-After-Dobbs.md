The University of Tennessee College of Law and the Appalachian Justice Research Center (AJRC) invite applications for a two-year post-doctoral research fellow to join a multi-institution research team funded to document the criminalization of pregnancy in the United States in the three years after the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health. The full study includes an extensive, multi-institution effort to locate and describe every case of pregnancy criminalization in the states during the three-year period after Dobbs. The fellow will work primarily with the research team and grassroots partners to design and conduct in-depth case studies of individuals whose pregnancies were criminalized during the relevant period.
