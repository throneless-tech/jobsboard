The Operations Associate (OA) will be a part of a broader team of program and operations professionals working with the Gender and Reproductive Equity grantmaking team to increase women (particularly Black women and women of color) and gender non-conforming peopleâ€™s: 1) political power and leadership; 2) knowledge, freedom and power to determine their reproductive lives; 3) economic power; and 4) freedom from sexual harassment and violence. The OA will manage the charitable and advocacy grantmaking administration and operations for the Gender and Reproductive Equity grantmaking portfolio. Liaising with HR, tech, legal and other operations staff, the OA will be responsible for managing the flow of grant-related and contracts transactions. The OA will use a variety of platforms to ensure seamless user experience internally and externally for the effective creation and processing of new and current grants, contracts and payments. The OA will interact directly with grantees to ensure the organization has the most accurate and up-to-date information in its grantmaking systems.
