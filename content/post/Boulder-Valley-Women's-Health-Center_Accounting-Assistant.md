We are looking for a motivated, highly organized and collaborative Accounting Assistant to support the Finance team. The Accounting Assistant is responsible for a variety of accounting and administrative duties, including accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll processing, month-end processing, credit card reconciliation and cash management. This is a part-time position (24 hours per week) with the potential to grow to a full-time position.
