CAI is a diverse, mission-driven nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the quality of health care and social services. From reproductive health and family planning to HIV prevention and trauma informed care, our mission remains the same â€” to use the transformative power of education and research to foster a more aware, healthy, compassionate, and equitable world. The Database and Quickbase Development Associate will primarily support two main tasks: 1) provide Quickbase development support to bring all current projects onto the restructured Quickbase, and 2) conduct data investigation, organization, and cleaning to support the archiving of past project data as it relates to participant registration information and training evaluation forms and reports. Confidence in Excel and Quickbase (or other low-code platforms) ideal.
