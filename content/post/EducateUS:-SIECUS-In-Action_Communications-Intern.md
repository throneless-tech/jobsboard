EducateUS: SIECUS In Action is building a movement of voters laser-focused on advancing progressive sex education policy and implementation across the country. As we are a new and growing organization, this is a great opportunity for an intern who wants to see how many facets of an advocacy organization work. The intern will assist the Executive Director in a variety of key communications activities, including but not limited to maintaining the social media accounts, news tracking, developing communications assets for organizing and campaign efforts, and more.
