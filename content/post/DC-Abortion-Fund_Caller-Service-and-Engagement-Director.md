Our ideal candidate will:
Be a detail-oriented, proactive problem solver with the ability to manage multiple cases simultaneously
Have a strong commitment to abortion access and reproductive health care, aligning personally and professionally with our values
Be comfortable working independently and as part of a team
Be confident in navigating the emotional toll of providing consistent compassionate support to callers seeking abortion services
Have exceptional client service and adaptability to work within the complex and ever-changing abortion access landscape

Candidates with personal or professional experiences aligning with the experiences of our callers, community, or movement (gender, economic, racial justice, etc.) are highly valued. This may include having had an abortion, direct exposure to the abortion funding or reproductive justice community, work in adjacent healthcare or social services sectors, or involvement in community organizing for progressive causes.
