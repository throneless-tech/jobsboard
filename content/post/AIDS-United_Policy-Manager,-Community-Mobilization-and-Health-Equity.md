Under the direction of the Director of Advocacy, the Policy Manager for Community Mobilization and Health Equity is responsible to assist in the analysis, development, and implementation of federal policies that will lead to an end of the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and support people’s ability to access HIV prevention, care and treatment services. This position will play a particularly crucial role in analyzing regulations, policy guidance, and legislation related to furthering racial and LGBTQ+ health equity, as well as ensuring that people living with and affected by HIV are meaningfully involved in AIDS United’s policy work. While the position will have specific focuses on health equity & working with the HIV community, they will also help guide all AIDS United Policy Department action alerts, regardless of the issue area and represent the organization in some of our coalition work. Further, this position will work closely with AIDS United’s Public Policy Council to develop and advocate policy recommendations and to educate Members of Congress, congressional and committee staff, key Administration officials and agency heads. The Policy Manager for Community Mobilization and Health Equity recommends and implements policy strategies and works with AIDS United’s Director of Advocacy and the Communications Department to send alerts and information to stakeholders, prepares advocacy talking points, and presents legislative strategies and updates.
