Much of your time will be spent on the computer in a virtual environment providing care to diagnose and treat issues and conditions related to reproductive, sexual health, abortion, and gender-affirming care. Much of your time will be spent using Electronic Health Records and the Electronic Practice Management system, documenting patient interactions, and running reports. Some of your time will be spent interacting with team members and collaborating with other departments. You may work from home or the office. You may be required to be in the office occasionally for administrative duties, training, or team building.
