The Major Gifts Officer is a brand new position that will help design and lead our major gifts program, in collaboration with our development team. This is a full-time position based out of JUFJ’s Washington, DC or Baltimore office, which is eligible to join our staff union (NPEU/Local 70, IFPTE). All staff can work remotely unless attending an event or action. JUFJ advances economic, racial, and social justice in DC and Maryland by educating and mobilizing local Jewish communities to action (you do not need to be Jewish to work at JUFJ).
