Most days will be spent assisting the HR Department in front of a computer managing documents, reading, sending, and responding to emails, and participating in virtual meetings. Days at our administrative office will be spent supporting in-person meetings, including managing catering, distributing materials, and room set-up and clean-up for training. Some of your time will be spent providing administrative tasks to other teams across the agency as needed.
