PWN-USA’s Policy Associate supports the organization’s national and state-level policy activities with a focus on state-level legislative efforts and movement building to decriminalize HIV led by directly impacted communities and on advancing meaningful partnerships and collaborations with other intersecting movements that address surveillance, policing, and mass incarceration, especially as they impact Black, Latinx, and trans communities. The Policy Associate is part of the Policy department and will report to the Policy Director. We are a non-traditional HIV organization committed to building power for our constituency, and our policy approaches and workplace culture reflect that. Our Policy Associate should be excited about taking on policy advocacy and legislative work that intersects with issue-based community organizing, electoral organizing strategies, and leadership development for our constituency.  This position, and our team, are fully remote. Travel is required when COVID safety allows. This position can be based anywhere in the United States, with a preference for the Southern US. 
We are a flexible and adaptive organization and responsive to a national membership base. We prioritize candidates who come with strong progressive values, a commitment to policy work informed and led by directly impacted constituencies, and who are able to think on their feet to adapt policy advocacy strategies in the moment. For candidates with more expertise, we may be open to constructing a slightly different position at a slightly higher salary range. Read more and apply at http://www.pwn-usa.org/about/opportunities/
