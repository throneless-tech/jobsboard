The Brigid Alliance seeks to add an Events Coordinator to its remote team to help the organization harness widespread interest in our work and sustain significant growth, beckoned by an increasing need for travel support among abortion seekers in the US. 

About: 
The Brigid Alliance (501c3) is a nationwide practical support organization that supports people who must travel long distances for abortion care. Working across the United States, we arrange and fund confidential travel, lodging, childcare, and logistical assistance, closing the gap between the need for an abortion and the ability to access one. We work in partnership with independent and nationally affiliated clinics, abortion funds, local and regional practical support organizations. The Brigid Alliance envisions a world where everyone has access to abortion care, uninhibited by stigma, and free of systemic or geographic barriers.

Since launching in August of 2018, The Brigid Alliance has assisted over 3,000 individuals and families from all 50 states. We are a crucial part of the reproductive health ecosystem connecting the geographic and metaphorical dots between policy, providers, practice, and patient. By alleviating the logistical barriers and financial obstacles of access to care, we are working to ensure that everyone has access to abortion care, no matter where they live.

Responsibilities:
The Events Coordinator will be part of a remote team that reports to the Director of Resource Development. Our budget has more than doubled year over year since inception, and this position is an integral part of sustaining our growing number of supporters at a time when our services are increasingly needed. As the Events Coordinator, you will bolster the capacity of the department, with a focus on leveraging goodwill for the organization and engaging with donors and volunteer fundraisers (individuals who volunteer to fundraise for The Brigid Alliance).
