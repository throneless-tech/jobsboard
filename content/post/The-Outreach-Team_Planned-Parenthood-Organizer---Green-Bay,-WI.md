Our access to reproductive healthcare is under attack across the nation like never before. As of June this year, Roe v Wade - the landmark legislation in the US that protects the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion - was overturned. The only way that we can win back reproductive healthcare rights in Wisconsin is to ensure that Planned Parenthood endorsed candidates win in November.

We are currently hiring part-time and full-time Campus Organizers to hit the ground running and turn out reproductive freedom voters on campuses across Wisconsin. Increasing voter turnout is one of the keys to reproductive health champions winning in November, and we must win if we are going to be able to address systemic issues impacting the most vulnerable communities in our country.

Campus Organizers will organize through relational networks across campus, engage and train student volunteers and leaders on grassroots actions, and coordinate volunteer events in partnership with campus organizations to build visibility and execute a successful GOTV campaign
