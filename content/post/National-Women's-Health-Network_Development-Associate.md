Do you want to apply your fundraising talent to the growth of a nonprofit that is on the frontlines of supporting women’s health? Do you want to be challenged, collaborate with others on meaningful policy and consumer education, and make a significant impact on the field of women’s health? The Development Associate is responsible for implementing a comprehensive and strategic fundraising program in support of the Network’s vision, mission, and strategic priorities. We are looking for someone who will be a go-getter, self-starter, big-picture, strategist with an eye for detail and a willingness to support the entire fundraising process as well as working collaboratively with other teams. This is a great opportunity for someone who wants not just a job but an opportunity to educate the American public about women’s health issues and hold federal agencies and institutions accountable to health topics that matter to women.
