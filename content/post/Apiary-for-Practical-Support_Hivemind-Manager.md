In late 2020, Apiaryâ€™s Executive Director started managing biweekly calls between practical support organizations (PSOs) that a frontline worker had started a few months before. These calls, which continue today, have been an essential space to build community, share resources and strategies, and brainstorm new paths forward together through an unpredictable landscape. They are the built-in space to hear what PSOs are thinking, which we use to identify key priorities for the organization. There is now also a listserv, a Slack, a Signal group and a shared drive, over 60 organizations and over 200 staff members and volunteers in these community spaces - we call them the Hivemind. We are now hiring someone to hold this project and identify ways for it to improve and deepen. This includes organizing internal and external speakers to present at the biweekly calls, monitoring and overseeing the other shared spaces, ensuring accurate data keeping, and making sure the community gets regular updates on our work across all platforms. They will be the key point of contact for all the organizations and individuals within the Hivemind and collaborate across team members to make sure that needs and concerns that arise in those spaces are being reflected across all of our work.

This role is not an entry-level position; the Hivemind Manager is expected to be an experienced virtual community manager and adept at facilitating digital spaces, identifying needs, and building comprehensive systems for holding and managing a lot of complex information. They have excellent relationship-development and communication skills and are effective at building trust across culture, identity, and power.
