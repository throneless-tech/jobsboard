Catholics for Choice (CFC) is seeking an eager administrative fundraiser that is passionate about the intersection of faith and reproductive rights to serve as our Development Associate. The ideal candidate to join our team is an ambitious go-getter who is eager to learn how to use Salesforce and digital platforms to raise funds during this critical time. We are looking for a detail-oriented system builder who can help track our donors through the giving cycle and help innovate use of our database. This is a role for someone early in their career who has an interest in diving in and learning on the job in a supportive environment. 

The Development Associate joins a growing Development team of two additional full-time positions. We value work-life balance and plan well in advance, so we have the space for rapid-response, with occasional need for urgent response and event support outside of traditional work hours. Someone successful in this role has a deep commitment to upholding an organizational culture of inclusion, transparency, generosity, mutual respect, and admiration. Candidates must demonstrate a strong belief in and actively support the philosophy and mission of CFC.
