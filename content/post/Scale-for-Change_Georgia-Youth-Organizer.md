Scale for Change, in partnership with Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, is seeking a full time, temporary organizer to run a field program in target districts with the goal of building diverse volunteer teams to reach voters of color under 35 and turn them out to vote. This organizer will utilize traditional and non-traditional field organizing tactics to make deep relationships in the communities they aim to reach, recruit volunteers to engage in these tactics, and meet ambitious but realistic goals to win in key electoral districts.
