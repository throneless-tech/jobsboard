Much of your time will be spent on the computer in a virtual environment providing daily expert care to patients receiving abortion, family planning, and gender-affirming care. You will make outbound and take inbound calls from patients to address their follow-up plans or concerns. Much of your time will be spent using Electronic Health Records, documenting patient interactions, and running reports. Some of your time will be spent interacting with team members and collaborating with other departments. You may work from home or the office. You may be required to be in the office occasionally for administrative duties, training, or team building.
