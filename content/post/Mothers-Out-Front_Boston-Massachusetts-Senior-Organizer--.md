The Boston Massachusetts Senior Organizer builds community teams that carry out effective campaigns to move decision makers to make child-centered climate justice decisions. You will help us focus resources particularly in those communities who suffer the injustices of climate change and fossil fuel use today and have been historically marginalized. We have passionate volunteer-led teams across Massachusetts, advocating for a swift transition away from fossil fuels towards clean and renewable energy, and are committed to deepening and expanding this critical movement. As the Senior Organizer, you will work to build teams who carry out effective campaigns that move decision makers to make child-centered climate decisions through a climate-justice lens.
