The Patient Care Guide (PCG) serves as an integral part of the team, creating a supportive patient experience and ensuring patient safety. PCGs provide unique and extremely valuable care for patients while working in conjunction with physicians, advanced practice clinicians, and nurses. The PCG will report directly to the Associate Manager, Patient Care. The PCG provides critical informational, emotional, and physical support for patients during their procedures and recovery, as well as assisting clinicians and administrative staff with clinic operations.
