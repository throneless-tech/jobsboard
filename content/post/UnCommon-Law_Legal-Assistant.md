The Legal Assistant provides support for the Supervising Attorney for In-Prison Programs to ensure timely and effective case management and support with legal workshops. This position consists of providing administrative support in the form of spreadsheet management, client correspondence, visit scheduling, and other necessary tasks. There is also an opportunity to provide substantive client support through participating in legal visits and correspondence and helping facilitate legal workshops. This full-time position is exempt, based in Los Angeles, and has a salary of $70,700. This role will mostly work remotely, with some in-prison work (CSP-Los Angeles County in Lancaster, and other institutions as needed) and some required travel to the Bay Area for team events and training. Mileage to and from California state prisons (or other off-site locations) will be reimbursed from your home location.
