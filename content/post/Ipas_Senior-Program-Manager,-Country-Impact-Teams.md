The Senior Program Manager (SPM), Country Impact Team (CIT) advances Ipas’s mission by providing strategic programmatic, technical, and operational support to select countries within Ipas. The SPM operates with high levels of autonomy and leverages their strategic leadership, risk management, and collaboration skills to provide support to Ipas country programs that self-assess as being less resourced and/or having more support needs from the CIT. They model shared leadership approaches and play a critical role in supporting Ipas country programs/nodes to deliver on their strategic objectives; strengthen their institutional governance, program/project management, financial management, and administrative functions; and cultivate new business and partnerships to grow their brand and impact. The SPM also directly supports complex awards/programs, serving as needed as the main donor/partner liaison for the awards and working collaboratively across matrixed global teams to deliver on award scope within schedule, budget, and at quality standards. They may also supervise up to two other staff members.
