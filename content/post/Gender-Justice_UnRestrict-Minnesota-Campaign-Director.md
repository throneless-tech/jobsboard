Gender Justice is seeking a dedicated, passionate, talented UnRestrict Minnesota Campaign Director to manage a multi-racial, cross-sector campaign and 28-member coalition to educate and engage Minnesotans on abortion restrictions and reproductive justice in Minnesota, advocate for reproductive freedom at the Minnesota Legislature, and support on-going litigation aimed at striking down the current abortion restrictions.  A successful campaign director will be adept at working both with a high level autonomy and also collaboratively with colleagues and coalition partners.
