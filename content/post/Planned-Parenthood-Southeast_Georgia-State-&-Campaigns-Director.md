The Georgia State & Campaigns Director (GSCD) will serve as the strategic driving force in the state to support the mission of Planned Parenthood Southeast. The GSCD’s duties include protecting access to reproductive health care through assisting with development and implementation of legislative, power building, and electoral campaigns. The GSCD will create and implement field programs that will engage supporters and volunteers through meaningful training and engagement opportunities, including campaigns to build power to leverage on
behalf of the communities we serve by increasing our supporter base and capacity. In addition, the GSCD works with the VPEA and other staff and volunteers to further the educational, political, and electoral goals of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates including electing legislators who support access to a full range of reproductive health care. The GSCD will directly manage and support Public Policy and Organizing Manager (PPOM) and support the
Georgia Field Organizers. At least 60% of the GCD’s time will be allocated to 501(c)3 campaign work.
