The CARLA coordination center is seeking nurses with a commitment to reproductive justice and experience in abortion care to provide care coordination to some of the most vulnerable patients seeking abortion care across the Midwest. CARLA (Complex Abortion Referral Line for Access) is a NEW referral center that will be staffed by registered nurses who will provide intake and care coordination for patients seeking medically complex hospital-based abortion care. The nurse position is based at Rush University Medical Center, and requires majority in-person work. However, CARLA is a statewide network, and responsibilities involve daily collaboration with physicians, nurses, and coordinators at multiple hospitals and abortion clinics in Illinois, as well as cross-training and close partnership with the Chicago Abortion Fund.
