The Data + Operations Associate will be deeply committed to gender, reproductive, and racial equity, and eager to learn how CGRE facilitates the power of philanthropy to fund and strengthen social movements. They will understand how operations and administrative functions can be fundamental to sustaining and growing healthy, adaptive organizations. They will see data as central to analysis and learning, and strive for clarity and accuracy in data entry, synthesis, and writing. The Associate will be responsible for data and operations functions related to fundraising, communications, and grants management. A meticulous professional who loves data and operational processes will thrive in this role; it is not geared toward those pursuing a career on the program side of social justice nonprofits.
