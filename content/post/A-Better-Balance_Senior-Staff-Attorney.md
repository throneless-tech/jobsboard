A Better Balance seeks a highly-motivated Senior Staff Attorney to support our state-level and federal-level work through a dynamic blend of legislative and policy advocacy, rulemaking and equitable implementation, legal research and writing, technical assistance, and coalition engagement. This position provides an exciting opportunity to gain expertise on a range of work-family justice issues including paid family and medical leave, paid sick time, and anti-discrimination policies focused on supporting pregnant and lactating workers and family caregivers.

The position will be supervised by A Better Balanceâ€™s Vice President. Although the position is remote, occasional travel will be expected when necessary to attend conferences, advocate in person for legislative and regulatory policies, or attend meetings at A Better Balance offices.
