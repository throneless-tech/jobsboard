Gender Justice and Gender Justice Action are nonprofit legal, policy, and political advocacy organizations working to advance gender equity through the law. We work to create a world where everyone can thrive no matter their gender, gender identity or expression, or sexual orientation. Central to this work is dismantling the legal, political, and structural barriers to gender equity. We represent clients directly in state and federal court and before administrative agencies in impact litigation cases. In addition to pursuing justice through the legal system, we advocate for policies that expand gender equity and seek to educate and shape public understanding about gender barriers. We’re a small but mighty organization looking for the newest member of our ambitious, highly-effective, and growing team.
