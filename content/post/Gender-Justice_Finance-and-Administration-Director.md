Gender Justice and Gender Justice Action are nonprofit legal, policy and political advocacy organizations based in St. Paul, Minnesota working to advance gender equity through the law. We fight discrimination based on sex, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We represent clients directly in state and federal court and before administrative agencies in impact and strategic litigation cases. In addition to pursuing justice through the legal system, we also advocate for policies that expand gender equity and educate the public about their rights and how to fight gender discrimination. This is an exciting time at Gender Justice and Gender Justice Action as we expand our programs and build our team. Weâ€™re a small but mighty organization looking for the newest member of our ambitious, highly-effective, and growing team.
