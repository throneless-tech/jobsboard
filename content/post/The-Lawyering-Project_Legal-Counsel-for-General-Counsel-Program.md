In 2023, the Lawyering Project launched the General Counsel Program. Housed in our Access & Innovation Program, the General Counsel Program provides general counsel services to abortion funds, practical support organizations, and other grassroots organizations working to support abortion access.  In the current legal landscape, where many states have banned or severely restricted abortion access, these groups play a huge role in helping people obtain abortion care across state lines. Our General Counsel Program offers these grassroots organizations the kind of legal advice that an in-house counsel would typically provide.  In 2024, the General Counsel Program aims to expand its legal services to include healthcare providers delivering abortion care services.  We are seeking an experienced attorney to join this program who will provide legal advice and technical assistance to the programâ€™s clients.
