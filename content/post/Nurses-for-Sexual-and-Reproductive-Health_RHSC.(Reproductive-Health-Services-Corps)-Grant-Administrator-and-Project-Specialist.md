NSRH has recently been awarded a substantial grant through the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) as a part of the Reproductive Health Services Corps (RHSC). The Corps is comprised of 6 organizations: TEACH, UCSF School of Nursing, CSU East Bay, NSRH, ACTIONS, and the Black Midwifery Fellowship. The purpose of the RHSC is to develop and/or update current curricula to provide comprehensive reproductive health care training, including abortion care to scope of practice for various health care professionals throughout the state of California. TEACH is the lead organization, with the rest of us acting as sub-contractors under the grant. As a part of our work on this project, NSRH is coordinating several partner organizations to ensure that Doulas, RNs, LVNs, Medical Assistants, Paramedics, and Community Health Workers receive the education and training that they need in sexual and reproductive healthcare including abortion care provision to scope of practice. This is a full-time, salaried position that is associated with a 4-year grant that may or may not be renewed at the end of the initial 4-year tem. This position will report directly to the Executive Director.
