The Associate General Counsel, Policy & Network Support collaborates closely with the General Counsel to offer responsive, practical, and values-aligned information and advice to support the programs, operations, and membership of the National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF). They serve as a thought partner to NNAF’s departments, staff, and network of abortion funds as they navigate the shifting legal landscape that applies to abortion access, and envision and pursue opportunities to amplify the voices and experiences of abortion funds and people who have abortions in spaces where laws and policies are made or changed. In partnership with NNAF’s Movement Building Team and General Counsel, the Associate General Counsel plays a key role in envisioning and implementing the legal and policy strategy for the Network and positioning NNAF as a thought leader in the reproductive health, rights, and justice movement.
