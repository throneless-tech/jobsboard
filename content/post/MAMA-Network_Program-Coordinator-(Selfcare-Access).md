MAMA is a regional movement working to share evidence-based and stigma-free information about self-managed medication abortion and sexual and reproductive health and rights directly with women at the community level. MAMA membership is currently 74 groups in 24 African countries, with plans to deepen our impact and expand our reach over the next years. You will lead our Self-Care Access program, which supports our members in expanding womenâ€™s access to SMA in their countries.
