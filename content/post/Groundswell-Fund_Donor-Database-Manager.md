The Donor Database Manager role is a new position at Groundswell. This person works closely with the Communications Director, Donor Relations Director, and Foundation Relations Director to maintain data integrity across the Advancement Department using Neon CRM as the primary system. This role will be responsible for data management, reporting, analysis, quality control, and enabling Advancement staff to use the system to work more strategically and effectively. The Donor Database Manager will oversee the tracking of fundraising data relevant to the organization’s fundraising goals as outlined in Groundswell’s 2020-2025 Blueprint, our strategic plan to advance women of color-led power-building across the U.S. This position will also play a key role in supporting staff responsible for grant seeking, foundation relations, major giving, and donor communications, as well as working collaboratively with all members of the team to bolster Groundswell’s growth and long-term sustainability. 

The ideal candidate for this role is a strategic, analytical thinker with strong interpersonal skills, a flexible mindset, and a passion for project management. Because this is a new position at the organization, someone who enjoys assessing needs, creating new systems and processes, and then working with staff to implement them would be an especially good fit. The person who will thrive as Donor Database Manager is comfortable working collaboratively in a diverse, fast-paced remote environment; is self-motivated and highly organized, with exceptional attention to accuracy; is a proactive problem solver who can manage multiple deadlines simultaneously; and understands the importance of discretion and confidentiality when handling sensitive funder/donor information.
