Help us strengthen our Black Communities! Black Futures Lab understands the problems facing Black communities are complex. Black Futures Lab works with Black people to transform communities, build black political power and change the way that power operates locally, statewide, and nationally. Our campaign will be going door to door to build political power in black communities by engaging voters and identifying issues most important to the Black community, educating and organizing around those issues, and building networks of informed, fired-up voters for the fall midterm elections.
