Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health is seeking a full-time Sexual Violence Prevention (SVP) Project Coordinator to oversee the Michigan Youth (MY) Consent Culture program. The SVP Project Coordinator oversees the coordination and implementation of activities specified in the MDHHS SVP program to coordinate a transformational systemic project to address structural deficits in the quality and accessibility of consent education and services for youth in Michigan.  The SVP Project Coordinator will work to institute a high-functioning statewide delivery system to support health educators in serving the sexual violence prevention needs among K-12 youth while shifting social norms and mobilizing allies around sexual violence prevention.  This grant runs through September 2023 with the intention to apply for renewal for additional years.
