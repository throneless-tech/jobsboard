Under the direct supervision of the Director of the Gender, Adolescent Transitions and Environment (GATE) program in the Department of Sociomedical Sciences at the Mailman School of Public Health, the Senior Program Manager provides oversight and technical support for multiple program activities including research operations, the management of projects globally and in the USA, partnership building and fundraising. GATE is an innovative research and practice program dedicated towards improving the lives of adolescents and women around the world. We are looking for an individual who brings a technical background and aptitude for managing people and who is looking for an opportunity that is aligned with our areas of work, including pubertal health transitions, menstrual health and hygiene, and access to sanitation. The Senior Program Manager will collaborate closely with the larger GATE team of staff and students. The position will involve some international travel. This position is dependent upon availability of grant funding. Subject to business needs, we may support hybrid work arrangements. Options will be discussed during the interview process.
