This past year, students across New York have been organizing for abortion pill access at student health centers on CUNY and SUNY campuses, leading to an active piece of legislation, A.1395A/S.1213. The bill has received support from the Governor, and we are now actively recruiting for 25 students from CUNY/SUNY campuses to help us pass this bill and ensure youth voices are represented in its implementation!


Joining the student advisory board is a perfect opportunity for young people who want to expand reproductive justice in their communities, on their campus, and throughout New York. 

Eligibility: Resident of New York State and currently a student at a City University of New York (CUNY) or State University of New York (SUNY) school. 

Details about the Student Advisory Board Role:

Board members will raise awareness about the bill and abortion access on their campus, advise policymakers and campus leaders about the implementation of the proposed legislation, and organize other students to advocate for reproductive justice. 

Board members will receive an in-person training on March 25th in New York City, with transportation and hotel accommodations covered. This training will cover the following:

-Basics of Reproductive Justice and Medication Abortion

-Organizing on Your Campus

-Legislative Details for Abortion Pills on Campus in New York

-Communication Strategy and Tips

Board members will receive $100 to attend the training in March and then a $100 monthly stipend from April to June 2023, with the possibility of resuming in August 2023 for the school year.
