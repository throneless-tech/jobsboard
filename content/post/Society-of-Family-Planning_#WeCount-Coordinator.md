The Society has been documenting service delivery changes and the resulting unmet need for abortion through #WeCount, an initiative that gathers as close to “real time” data, by state, on shifts in abortion access following the Dobbs v Jackson’s Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision to overturn the federal right to abortion. In the past year, findings have been referenced widely in the public discourse regarding shifting abortion access and, due to significant support from service-delivery and community partners, #WeCount continues to serve as a key resource in describing the impact of the Dobbs ruling. We seek a collaborative, capable, and driven professional to support the implementation of #WeCount. This position will play a key role in maintaining relationships with abortion providers and community partners, and ensuring consistent data collection and the accessibility of quarterly reports.
