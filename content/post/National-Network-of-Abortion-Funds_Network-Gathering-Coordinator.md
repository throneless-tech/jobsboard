Are you looking for us?
You have a passion and skill for event planning as a way to intentionally gather people together for powerful purposes, online and in-person, knowing that a connected and aligned network is greater than the sum of its parts. You are the go-to party planner or gatherer wherever you go, whether that is movement, organizing, or other cultural spaces. You’re that dream guest who’s always checking in with the host about how you can help make the space come alive. You are excited to use those skills to bring together many different groups and people to achieve ambitious, complex goals—such as supporting collaboration between funds for caller-centered service delivery. You are ready to implement the spaces that our regions, network, and movement need in this political moment.
