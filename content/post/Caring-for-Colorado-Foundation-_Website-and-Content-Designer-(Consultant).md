The Colorado Collaborative for Reproductive Health Equity (the Collaborative) seeks to advance equitable approaches to sexual and reproductive health and rights for communities across the state. Deeply rooted in the belief that all people must have the power to make decisions about their bodies and future, the Collaborative centers children, youth, and their families to increase access to comprehensive services and sex (or health) education and sexual and reproductive rights.
The Collaborative is seeking a Website and Content Designer that can guide staff in the development and presentation of content and create a website to:
• present our body of work, accomplishments and contributions to the field of reproductive health equity;
• engage past, current, and future partners on potential projects; and
• uplift our values for equity and community in an authentic and appealing manner.
