The Director of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) is a new role for our organization. This is an exciting opportunity for a seasoned EDI practitioner to join Upstream in leading both the strategic and day-to-day operational advancement of our equity, diversity and inclusion journey. Reporting to the Chief of Staff, the Director of EDI will be a trusted thought partner across the organization, executing against the current EDI strategy and working closely with leadership to advance annual priorities with an EDI lens and will help inform our external EDI approach. 
The Director of EDI will design new programs and governance structures where none existed before. The focus of this position is to continuously strengthen our organizational culture and effectiveness through a holistic Equity, Diversity and Inclusion strategy that accomplishes 3 goals: 1) ensures all people (including those who have been historically underrepresented based on race/ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, veteran status and disability) are treated fairly in the work of our mission; 2) supports our employees to collectively pursue a shared vision of equity, diversity and inclusion; and 3) helps us create a people experience where all Upstreamers  feel comfortable bringing their true and authentic selves to work each day. 

The ideal candidate is deeply passionate about our mission and working with Upstreamers at all levels to enhance the employee experience and organizational culture through various equity, diversity and inclusion strategies, programming and learning opportunities.
