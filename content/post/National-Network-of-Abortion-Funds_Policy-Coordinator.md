The Policy Coordinator is responsible for providing coordination and support with tracking, analyzing, strategizing, and organizing around key legal, policy, and political developments that impact abortion access for people seeking abortions and the member funds who support them. As such, the Policy Coordinator contributes to meaningful connection with and support of funds, keeps a pulse on policy developments, and provides logistical and administrative support necessary to execute the policy teamâ€™s innovative and responsive strategies. The Policy Department at the National Network of Abortion Funds works to engage with member abortion funds to shape and respond to policy changes at multiple levels of government and at the intersection of racial, economic, and reproductive justice.
