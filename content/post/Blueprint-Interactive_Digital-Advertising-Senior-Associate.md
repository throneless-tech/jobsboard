Blueprint is hiring a Digital Campaign Senior Associate to join our advertising team. We're looking for a bright, analytic mind who thinks critically and takes initiative to anticipate and solve problems.

We work on behalf of our clients to defend access to womenâ€™s health, the environment, and other progressive issues. If you are a curious, collaborative person and passionate about wanting to drive real change, Blueprint is the right place for you.

We have flexible work from home policies but we have a preference for location in the DMV for this position.
