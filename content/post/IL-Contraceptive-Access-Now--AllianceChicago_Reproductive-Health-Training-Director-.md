The  ICAN  Reproductive  Health  Training  Director  (RHTD)  is  responsible  for  assessing, developing, and delivering virtual and in-person trainings to increase community health center capacity to provide patient-centered,  evidence-based  contraceptive  care,  free  of  financial  barrier.    The  RHTD  must  have  experience engaging  front  line  health  care  staff  via  various  training  modalities  with  the  aim  to  create  a  culture  where contraceptive needs and desires are routinely screened for and documented via complete and accurate billing and coding for every encounter with a person of reproductive age. The RHTD must have a fundamental understanding of reproductive justice and the role of unconscious bias in the delivery of trauma-informed care for people with fewer resources.  The  RHTD  will  be  responsible  for  identifying  gaps  and  capitalizing  on  assets  to  support  health  center staff  in  providing  respectful  contraceptive  counseling  and  services  for  all  FDA-approved  contraceptive  methods
