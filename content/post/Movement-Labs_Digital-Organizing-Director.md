Movement labs is hiring for the role of Digital Organizing Director for the 2024 cycle. This role is a mission critical position for our Political Innovation Incubator - it leads execution for any political innovation idea that involves contacting humans in digital communities and online forums with paid staff, volunteers, and automations.

This role will be responsible for moving dozens of ideas through the process of vetting, scoping and project planning and piloting them to assess if they have the potential to net over 1000 votes across the seven battleground states. If pilots are successful, work includes scaling those ideas up ahead of the 2024 election. This role will report to the VP of Political Innovation and will work closely with the Incubator Director and SMS team.

Our ideal candidate is an organizing strategist with deep familiarity of online communities and volunteer and voter engagement. We are looking for someone who loves tough challenges, is extremely scrappy and creative and has a get-to-yes attitude.

This role will oversee several pilot projects. Two examples: Online Community Organizing - recruiting and training active online forum users in hundreds of forums to engage in persuasive conversation and meme-making to move undecided voters to vote for Biden. Partnering vendors that work with Macro & Micro influencers at scale to engage their followers in electioneering conversations.
