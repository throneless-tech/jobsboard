National Partnership for Women & Families, with the support of the Huber Foundation, is launching the inaugural year of the Huber Reproductive Health Equity Legal Fellow. This is a one-year fellowship opportunity offering recent law school graduates a professional development opportunity focused on federal reproductive health policy and law. The Fellow will work with the Health Justice and Congressional Relations teams on various issues around advocacy for reproductive health, rights, and justice. Areas of focus will include abortion access and coverage, contraception and other sexual and reproductive health issues, as well as related intersectional issues.

This Fellowship is for one year, beginning in May. The Fellow will be supervised by attorneys in National Partnership’s Health Justice team and will learn the federal reproductive health policy landscape while also honing skills in administrative advocacy, rapid response to key reproductive rights court decisions, policy analysis and federal policy tracking, tracking relevant cases in the courts, and policy and legal research and writing. Note that the National Partnership is not a litigating organization, and litigation is not a part of this fellowship. The team’s goal is for the Fellow to have a positive growth experience at the National Partnership that will serve as a launchpad into future work.
