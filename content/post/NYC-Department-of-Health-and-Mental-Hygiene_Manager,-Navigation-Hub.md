The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Maternal Infant and Reproductive Health is establishing an Abortion Access Hub where all people who might seek information on where and how to obtain an abortion can call and speak to a Navigator. Navigators will conduct brief interview with callers to: 1) Find out their abortion needs based on type of abortion, preferred location, date/time availability, and insurance 2) Do a needs assessment on whether they require additional funding and/or support to access care (such as transportation, child care, housing, etc) 3) Provide warm handoff to a provider or support services depending on identified needs. The Hub Manager will ensure that navigators are following all scripts, policies and procedures provided by DOHMH through periodic evaluation and refresher training, and that staff are complying with DOHMH training regarding handling of confidential information.
