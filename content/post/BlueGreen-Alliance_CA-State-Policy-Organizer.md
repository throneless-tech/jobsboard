The BlueGreen Alliance (BGA) seeks qualified candidates for the position of California State Policy Organizer  (CSPO). The successful candidate will work remotely from California (CA) and be available for regular travel to/in the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento area. The CSPO will report to the CA State Policy Manager and the Western States Director. The California State Policy Organizer is responsible for maintaining and growing the CA BGA organizing Table (a statewide coalition of labor and environmental partners). The CSPO develops and implements organizing strategies to grow public awareness and advance BGA policy initiatives. The coalition’s current strategic priority is making CA a leader in clean industry, manufacturing, energy, and sustainable water use, including the production of low-carbon materials and clean energy, and advancing high-road labor policies. The policy organizer’s other outreach and advocacy work will be driven by Table members' shared interests and capacity. This may include, but is not limited to, tightening safety standards at industrial facilities, growing access to zero-emission vehicles, and promoting high-road labor standards in clean energy development. The CSPO provides organizing and communications support to the CA State Policy Manager to achieve BGA policy initiatives. The CSPO will work with BGA staff, labor unions, environmental groups, environmental justice groups, and other allies.
