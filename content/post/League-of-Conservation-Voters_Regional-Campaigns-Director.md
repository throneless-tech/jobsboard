LCV is hiring two Regional Campaigns Directors to support our issue advocacy and electoral campaigns. Each Regional Campaigns Director will manage programs for approximately 16 states in coordination with state LCV partners and national allies in consultation with the National Campaigns Director. The ideal candidate will be able to implement federal program strategy and collaborate with state LCV partners on state or local priorities, while centering racial justice and equity, with the goal of building a stronger Conservation Voter Movement (CVM) that includes federal, state and local wins.
