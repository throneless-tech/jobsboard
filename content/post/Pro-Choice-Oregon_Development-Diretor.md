Pro-Choice Oregon seeks to identify, support, and welcome our next permanent Development Director to our team. At Pro-Chocie Oregon, we believe in reproductive freedom, racial equity and social justice â€” and are working to ensure our fundraising efforts are consistent with these values. We are looking to fully support and onboard a new member of our team who is excited to help build strong political fundraising programs, while continuing to learn more and operationalize community-centric fundraising strategies into our development planning and programs.
