The California Pan-Ethnic Health Network (CPEHN) is seeking a full-time Communications Director. CPEHN is a statewide health policy organization focused on addressing racial and ethnic health disparities. CPEHN works closely with communities of color across the state to elevate local voices and health issues to state and local policymakers and help communities of color advance policy change and structural reform that creates equitable conditions for their communities. California applicants are preferred but other remote work locations will be considered. CPEHN maintains physical offices in Oakland and Sacramento and has a hybrid work policy. CPEHN has a mandatory up-to-date COVID-19 vaccine policy. 

The Communications Director is responsible for directing, developing, and overseeing CPEHN’s communications strategy through high-level, strategic visioning, a deep understanding of racial equity, implementation of campaigns and programs, and brand stewardship. This position is responsible for content and messaging generation for diverse audiences and platforms, managing projects and relationships with key stakeholders and consultants, and continuing to grow CPEHN’s leadership in the field of health equity. They will work with all staff to increase organizational visibility, promote our policy agenda, and develop media relationships. 

We are looking for a creative thinker and strong collaborator who has experience leading messaging and communications strategies. We are looking for someone with experience working with media, policy campaign experience, and a wide array of communications skills (social media, graphic design, project management, communications strategy, etc). The ideal candidate is someone with a strong health equity lens, who has a keen eye for detail, and strong written and verbal communication skills. Our next Director of Communications will be someone who shares CPEHN’s commitment to health equity and racial justice.
