Access Bridge aims to revolutionize access to reproductive healthcare in EDs. The program empowers healthcare providers to increase stigma-free access to contraception and treatment for pregnancy emergencies from the ED, particularly in abortion-restricted states and regions. The program coordinator will work closely with the Access Bridge principal investigator (PI) and will collaborate regularly with other members of the Bridge program staff. This position is primarily remote, working with a team based across the country, with the requirement of attending periodic in-person meetings throughout the year in Oakland, CA.
