NYAAF is looking for an intern from early June-late August 2023 to support with key intake, fundraising, administrative, communications, and community organizing tasks while building community and learning more about the movement for abortion access. As an abortion fund, we first and foremost seek to center and foster the leadership of people who have had abortions, people who have used abortion funds, and people who have experienced difficulty accessing abortion. We also seek to center groups most impacted by reproductive oppression and other intersecting injustices in our leadership. Black, Indigenous peoples, and other people of color, trans and gender nonconforming people, folks from low-income communities, people with disabilities, immigrants, young parents, and people at the intersections of these identities and other marginalized groups are strongly encouraged to apply.
