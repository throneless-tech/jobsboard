ANSIRH seeks a research consultant to work on a qualitative study looking at the role of virtual or telehealth care in addressing barriers among medication abortion patients in the U.S. This position would be ideal for a graduate student or early career scientist. The study will branch off from the larger California Home Abortion by Telehealth (CHAT) Study which aims to understand the experiences of people who use an online service for their abortion care. The consultant will work under the supervision of the Project Director and in collaboration with the Principal Investigator, Ushma Upadhyay, PhD MPH, Associate Professor. The consultant will assist in scheduling and conducting qualitative interviews (remotely), contribute to data analysis, as well as other research assistance as needed. This contract position is tentatively planned for March â€“ August 2022 with some flexibility. A minimum of 10 hours per week is required, the majority of which should be during daytime hours and may depend on the availability of study participants. The consultancy can be done from any U.S. location.  A stipend will be provided along with potential for co-authorship on any research papers produced from the data collected.
