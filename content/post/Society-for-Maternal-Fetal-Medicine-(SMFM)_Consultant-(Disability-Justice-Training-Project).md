SMFM seeks a consultant to develop introductory disability justice educational resources for patient and provider abortion advocates, with a focus on those who provide, refer for, or have lived experience with later abortion. For this project, Patient Forward will serve in an advisory role and work closely with SMFM and the consultant. We envision these resources consisting of written materials accompanied by a training video(s) - the latter can be pre-recorded or presented live with a recording available afterwards. This project will hopefully lay the groundwork for additional resources in the future.
