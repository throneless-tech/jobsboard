The Outreach Team is hiring experienced directors to run signature gathering offices for the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom ballot initiative. This ballot measure establishes the right for Nevadans to make and carry out decisions about their reproductive health, including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomies and tubal ligations, abortion and abortion care, and care for miscarriages and infertility. Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, abortion rights and access in this country are under attack like never before and itâ€™s crucial that Nevadans have the right to control their bodies.
