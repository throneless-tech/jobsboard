Mobile Clinic Drivers 

Just The Pill is a nonprofit organization started in 2020 by clinic workers to expand access to abortion care by mail and mobile clinic in Minnesota, Montana and Wyoming. We have grown to a team of four and are expanding to serve eastern New Mexico. We are committed to living wages and will not pay any staff or contractor below $23/hour. This fall we are transitioning all staff from independent contractors to paid with benefits for staff and families (able to be purchased when we have 6 or more staff members). 

The ideal candidate will be committed to Reproductive Justice and be willing to examine implicit bias in healthcare, be able to use EMR, telehealth platforms and text; be flexible in how care is provided to ensure that we are centering the patientâ€™s needs. No degree is required.

Just The Pill is an equal opportunity employer. Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), immigrants, women, and LGBTQ candidates are strongly encouraged to apply.
