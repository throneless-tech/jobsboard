In a district-wide, strategic effort to address health inequities that interfere with academic success, the Boston Public Schools (BPS) Office of Health and Wellness (OHW), in collaboration with Health Services, Safe and Welcoming Schools Program and other BPS departments, applied for and received funding from the Center for Disease Control, Promoting Adolescent Health Through School-Based HIV/STD Prevention and School-Based Surveillance Grant. The primary purpose of this funding is to build the capacity of districts and schools to effectively contribute to the reduction of HIV infection and other STDs among adolescents by (1) conducting school-based surveillance through the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and Profiles implementation; (2a) strengthening Sexual Health Education, (2b) strengthening access to & use of key health services and (2c) establishing & maintaining safe & supportive school environments. The SHS Specialist will work within the BPS Health and Wellness Department and The Health Services Department on a variety of sexual health initiatives in BPS.
