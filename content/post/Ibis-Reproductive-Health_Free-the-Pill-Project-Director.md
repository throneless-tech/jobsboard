We seek a Project Director with campaign management experience who is committed to work on reproductive health, rights, and justice to oversee the implementation of an ambitious program of work to move oral contraceptive pills (OCs) over the counter (OTC) in the United States. The OCs OTC Working Group and our outward-facing campaign, Free the Pill, form an innovative and exciting coalition effort between researchers, providers, pharmacists, advocates, and communities who currently face the most barriers to contraceptive access, including Black people, people of color, and Indigenous peoples, people struggling to make ends meet, and young people.
