We seek a Project Director with campaign management experience who is committed to work on reproductive health, rights, and justice to oversee the implementation of an ambitious program of work to move oral contraceptive pills (OCs) over the counter (OTC) in the United States. The OCs OTC Working Group and our outward-facing campaign, Free the Pill, form an innovative and exciting coalition effort between researchers, providers, pharmacists, advocates, and communities who currently face the most barriers to contraceptive access, including Black people, people of color, and Indigenous peoples, people struggling to make ends meet, and young people. We believe broad contraceptive access cannot be achieved without racial justice, and are committed to applying a reproductive justice lens across our work and advancing racial justice. Confronting the reality that contraceptive inequities are felt deeply by young people and that their access is most controversial, the Free the Pill campaign embraces a youth-adult partnership model in its work.

The Project Director will manage all aspects of the OCs OTC work, including partnerships with people who could benefit most from OTC access, and policy, advocate, and pharmaceutical company collaborators in efforts to ensure that future OTC pills are affordable, covered by insurance, and available to people of all ages. The Project Director will play a leadership role in the Free the Pill team at Ibis, the OCs OTC Working Group coalition and steering committee, and public-facing efforts to raise awareness about OCs OTC. Competitive candidates for this position will be experienced campaign managers who have a proven track record of managing the implementation of complex projects and working and communicating effectively with a diverse group of partners. We seek a candidate who can commit to seeing this project across the finish line of FDA approval for the first OTC OC, which we anticipate in the next couple of years. Preference for this position to be based in either of our two US offices. At present all staff have the option to work remotely or in offices following local public health guidance. When public health conditions related to COVID-19 allow, full-time work in offices will resume.
