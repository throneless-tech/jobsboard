SAFEMaine (SAFE) is a nonprofit organization that helps fund abortions for Mainers who cannot pay the full cost, by partnering with abortion providers across the state. SAFE seeks a dynamic, motivated Executive Director (ED) to lead the organization as we expand our reach and capacity. Our current structure is an all-volunteer board of 8 – 12 individuals with diverse backgrounds who all have a passion for ensuring abortion access. The ED reports to SAFE’s board of directors,and is responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the daily activities and operations of SAFE. This includes partnering with our providers, clinics, and state and national organizations within the scope of priorities set by the board.
