The DuPont Clinic is a referral center for all-trimester abortion and ultrasound-guided procedures, including for abnormal or high risk pregnancies, and for people with complex medical situations who may have difficulty accessing care.  We provide the highest level of medical care and a private experience focused on the individual needs of each patient. The DuPont Clinic is committed to creating an inclusive environment where individuals from all backgrounds feel comfortable. The Director of Clinical Services (DCS) will oversee all aspects of the patient experience, from the first scheduling phone call to their discharge and follow-up call. They will also oversee the clinical services and patient care guide teams. The DCS represents the clinic at local, national, and international meetings and supports the COO and Executive Director with big-picture clinic visioning, sustainability, and growth.
