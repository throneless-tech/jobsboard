We seek a strategic, nimble multi-tasker and leader with exceptional writing, editing, and verbal communication skills who is as comfortable working in traditional media as they are in emerging digital spaces, and who has strong familiarity with leading-edge conversations and messaging practices in reproductive justice. The Communications Director is responsible for crafting and implementing If/When/How’s overall communications strategy; supervising staff and, when necessary, hiring staff in the Communications Department; elevating and managing the If/When/How brand; media relations; and directing digital campaigns and collateral. The Communications Director will also direct the organization’s overall social media strategy and digital identity and online resources with the Communications Manager, and develop and direct content for online resources and web presences as needed in conjunction with the Technology Department. The candidate must be committed to centering, elevating, and developing the voices, expertise, and experiences of Black, Indigenous, and people of color; progressing narratives around reproductive health, rights, and justice; and growing the movement to lawyer for reproductive justice.
