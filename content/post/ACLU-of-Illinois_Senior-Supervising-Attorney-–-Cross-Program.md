The Senior Supervising Attorney will litigate cases in state and federal court, and work with colleagues to promote change through legislative initiatives, advocacy with government officials, and public education. Their goal will be to safeguard and expand access to reproductive and gender affirming health care, promote gender equity, protect and expand the rights of pregnant and parenting people and the LGBTQIA+ community in the workplace, and fight back against the use of religion as a license to discriminate.
