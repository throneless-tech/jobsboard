As the Climate Justice Lead Organizer, you will support and coach staff organizers and member leaders throughout our network to build base and leaders through their climate campaign work. You will build relationships, design materials (e.g. raps, flyers, curriculum, agenda, action toolkits, etc.), lead distributed organizing tactics (e.g. canvass, townhall, blitz and absorption, etc.), and run committees. You will ensure that all campaign work advances a base and power-building strategy, as that is at the center of everything that we do. You will work closely with member organizations, as well as the teamâ€™s Senior Strategist and Campaign Director, to execute razor-sharp and compelling campaigns that decarbonize society, create thousands of good clean-energy jobs, and advance racial, gender, and environmental justice.
