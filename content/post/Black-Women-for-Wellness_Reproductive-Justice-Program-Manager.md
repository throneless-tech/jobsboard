The role entails managing the development and infrastructure of programmatic initiatives under the BWW Reproductive Justice programs, alongside the implementation of relevant policies and procedures. This involves fostering collaboration among various stakeholders, including South Los Angeles/South Bay African American Infant Maternal Mortality Community Action Team (SLA/SB AAIMM CAT) organizations and Los Angeles County Health Agency staff. Facilitating meetings, events, and maintaining equitable participation, while documenting and sharing successes, are key responsibilities. Additionally, the position involves establishing evaluation systems, preparing reports, managing contracts, and data monitoring. Leading research for new partnerships, supporting policy development, and maintaining BWW's leadership in Reproductive Justice/Maternal Health policy are integral parts of the role. Oversight of Reproductive Justice Programs and effective collaboration with communication and civic engagement teams are central to achieving organizational goals. This role requires strong project management skills, advocacy experience, and a commitment to social justice. Frequent travel is expected. The position requires a Bachelor's degree in a related field, at least 5 years of relevant experience, and expertise in reproductive health issues.
