We Testify is seeking a Fundraising Manager to implement the organization's development plan and strategy to continue to elevate (and fund!) abortion storytellers as experts and leaders. The Fundraising Manager will be responsible for managing various aspects of the organization’s foundation support as well as creating a robust grassroots and major donor plan and retaining relationships with individual donors. They will also design and implement fundraising campaigns and events. The Fundraising Manager will work towards increasing the overall budget of the organization while ensuring that our funders and fundraising strategies are aligned with our values.

In this role, you will be working closely with our staff and our most ardent supporters to update them on We Testify’s programmatic and campaign work and how their resources can help abortion storytellers reach more people who’ve had abortions. You will be the person helping to tell the story of our organization and our impact to supporters, funders, partners, and donors. The Fundraising Manager will dream up creative ways to engage with donors who’ve had abortions, and the people who love them, and build a strong financial foundation for our organization to grow upon.
