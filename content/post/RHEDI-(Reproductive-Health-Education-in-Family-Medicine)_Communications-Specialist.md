RHEDI (Reproductive Health Education In Family Medicine) is hiring a Communications and Program Associate to implement our communications strategy, expand the impact of our work, and support our programs and operations. This position would be ideal for someone with strong communications and technology skills and an advocacy background in the abortion rights or Reproductive Justice movements.  RHEDI works to expand patient-centered abortion and contraception training in family medicine residencies, informed by a Reproductive Justice framework that centers on marginalized communities. We also strive to diversify the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) workforce by engaging BIPOC students, residents, and faculty.
