The Senior Program Associate, Reproductive and Maternal Health Ecosystem Building is a new role that will partner with the Chief Health Officer and venture investing colleagues from RH Capital to support early and growth-stage companies and other organizations in the reproductive and maternal health ecosystem. We seek someone with deep expertise in reproductive and maternal health equity, health care delivery systems, payer strategies, and the role of health technology to provide workshops, training, and support to reproductive and maternal health companies within our portfolio and in the broader ecosystem. This person should also be able to partner with birth justice and reproductive health, rights, and justice partners across the field and translate the needs of the women and other birthing people most affected by systemic inequity into programming that fosters equitable reproductive and maternal health products and services.
