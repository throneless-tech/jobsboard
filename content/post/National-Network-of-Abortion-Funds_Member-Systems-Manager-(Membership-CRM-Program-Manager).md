The Member Systems Manager is responsible for ensuring the full and effective use of a customized Salesforce instance for a pilot cohort of abortion funds (called Operation Scale Up or "OSU"). OSU is a key initiative of NNAF. The goal of the pilot is to provide full abortion funding and wraparound logistical support for callers seeking an abortion in the pilot region, and this Salesforce instance (named “Penny”) serves as the service delivery database for the pilot cohort. 

The Member Systems Manager manages, develops, and maintains Penny, working with external consultant support to implement improvements to the system and ensure the integrity and accessibility of data including but not limited to contact information, case management information, and structured reporting. In addition, the Member Systems Manager oversees management of network wide spaces for member abortion funds to connect with each other online and share knowledge (e.g. a Slack space, email mailing list). The position requires a high degree of collaboration with member abortion funds, tech vendors and consultants, and other NNAF staff members across all teams, with the aim of instilling and enabling a culture of effective use of Penny among the entire pilot cohort to more effectively provide service delivery in the pilot region.

Note that NNAF also has an internal Salesforce instance where we track our membership and donations, managed by the NNAF IT Team; Penny meets a very different purpose and is managed separately.
