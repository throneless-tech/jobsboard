Huckleberry Teen Health Program (HTHP) in San Rafael provides youth and families with support along a continuum of services that includes health promotion, education, screening and early intervention, peer health education for Spanish speaking communities, as well as other areas connected to sexual and reproductive health. The HTHP team works in close partnership with schools, community-based organizations, community clinics and community members, to address some of the most urgent issues in adolescent health. Additionally, HTHP facilitates a weekly youth focused clinic where youth can receive confidential and no-cost sexual and reproductive health services, using a model of care that integrates behavioral and mental health screening and intervention into clinic visits. All services are offered in both English and Spanish. The Health Educator is deeply embedded in HTHPâ€™s health promotion activities. The Health Educator is responsible for planning, executing, and documenting educational workshops, adapting curriculum, supporting clinic flow and conducting health counseling at Teen Tuesday Clinic, participating in community outreach, supporting intern and volunteer projects, and leading additional youth enrichment activities and programs. Responsibilities also include social media development and engagement.
