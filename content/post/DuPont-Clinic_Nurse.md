The DuPont Clinic is a referral center for all-trimester abortion and ultrasound-guided procedures, including for abnormal or high risk pregnancies, and for people with complex medical situations who may have difficulty accessing care.  The DuPont Clinic is committed to creating an inclusive environment where individuals from all backgrounds feel comfortable. We seek to hire a registered nurse (RN) who will be an integral part of the team creating the patient experience and ensuring patient safety. This position is part-time or full-time with a focus on Wednesdays Thursdays, and Fridays (Fridays will be necessary after orientation). There will be limited call from home and no nights or weekends. The right person for this position will have the highest standards for patient safety, be motivated to create a positive patient experience, strongly support bodily autonomy, and, ideally, speak a second language. This position will have the opportunities for learning, including ultrasound, abortion care, and gynecologic care.
