The Patient Navigator is a community health professional that helps guide abortion patients through the abortion care system and works to overcome obstacles faced by the patient. They relieve as much of the logistical and practical burdens from the patient as possible, such that the path to obtain high quality, patient-centered abortion care is as clear and smooth as possible. The Patient Navigator uses their experiences with patients to identify, address and make suggestions for improvement within internal systems and processes that affect access to care. 

This position is grant-funded for 1 year.
