The Lawyering Project is seeking an experienced attorney to manage a new set of pro bono initiatives.  In collaboration with other public interest legal organizations working to advance reproductive health, rights, and justice, our pro bono initiatives will ensure that every abortion patient, provider, and supporter who needs direct legal services in the post-Roe legal landscape will have access to high-quality representation regardless of their financial means.  The Senior Counsel for Pro Bono Initiatives will play a key role in designing and implementing these new initiatives and will be responsible for managing their day-to-day operations.
