The Project Manager, Office of CEO, will leverage their background in strategic planning, project planning, risk management and change management to support the office of the CEO with initiatives across multiple diverse, geographically distributed stakeholder groups. Upstream has both a COO and a CEO. The COO oversees day-to-day core execution. The Office of the CEO works cross-functionally to ensure day-to-day execution stays on track and also looks further out to transformation ideas that will shape the business and promote organizational effectiveness. These transformational ideas span from internal (e.g. driving Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion initiatives) to external (driving the next wave of growth). This cross-cutting role will collaborate with all departments to ensure special projects assigned to the Office of CEO make progress and reach timely completion.  Reporting to the Chief of Staff, our Project Manager will supervise an executive assistant who supports most of the senior leadership team and liaise closely with our senior executive assistant who supports our CEO and Development team. This individual will be intimately involved with ensuring the CEO's agenda for the organization comes to life through a variety of administrative, operational and strategic supports that drive efficiencies and execution, while dialing into effective communication levers that promote our core organizational values.
