The Self-Managed Abortion 101 through an RJ Lens Training was developed by the Abortion on Our Own Terms Campaign to help participants create a shared understanding of what a self-managed abortion is, how communities historically managed abortion care from a decolonized framework, and understand the risks around criminalization. We are in search of a consultant who can support the Campaign on our efforts to disseminate and engage partners with this training, as well as finalize the development and dissemination of a version of the curriculum specifically tailored for Black communities.
