The Community Education and Outreach Specialist will provide inclusive and medically accurate comprehensive health education and outreach in their community. The ideal candidate has experience navigating conversations around justice, health, and equity. We’re looking to grow our team with candidates with a strong DEIB background. Diverse candidates are strongly encouraged to apply. The Community Education and Outreach Specialist must be comfortable in a variety of settings and with diverse groups of people. They must operate with our shared values of LGBTQ+ inclusivity, antiracism, and sex positivity. The PPSE Education and Outreach team works at the intersection of health education and social justice. Our mission is to use education as a transformative tool for justice. We’re a dynamic, flexible, mission-driven team. Eagerness to learn, grow and improve is a must-have trait for this role, as well as a desire to show up for the community, be an excellent ambassador of the Planned Parenthood brand, and serve as a subject-matter expert in the community and within PPSE.
