Apiary for Practical Support (Apiary for short) is a very new organization launched in June of 2021 and was a staff of two through much of 2022 and are now looking to expand our team. While we work to do that, we are hiring an Operations Consultant to help us finalize and build some of the systems and processes we need to ensure that we are able to grow with a sure footing. This includes an array of operations systems including HR, finance, and data management.
