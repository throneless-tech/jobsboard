The Member Systems Associate is responsible for supporting activities and processes for network data and case management collaboration. As part of the Technical Assistance  (TA) team, they support member abortion funds in the data system by providing administrative support for co-designing the data system, building trust with abortion funds, and increasing network data competencies. They collect, normalize, and analyze membership data to assist the daily operations of individual abortion funds, as well as to support NNAF’s evaluation, strategic guidance, and reporting to external stakeholders. 

The Member Systems Associate interacts with NNAF member funds and other NNAF staff members, and is vital to NNAF’s success in meeting the network’s growing need for values-driven data systems. They are committed to bringing a racial, economic, and reproductive justice lens to traditional database competencies.
