We are currently seeking Voter Contact Field Directors to help get voters to the polls in critical battleground communities for the 2022 midterm elections. Increasing voter turnout is one of the keys to Democrats winning in November. We must win if Democrats are going to be able to address systemic issues impacting the most vulnerable communities in our country. Directors will work alongside a team of local canvassers on this voter contact campaign. Please note this is a temporary position that will run through the November election.
