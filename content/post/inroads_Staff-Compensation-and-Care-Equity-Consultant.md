Hiring, supporting, and compensating team members in varied local and country contexts presents challenges, both in terms of equity across the team, and compliance with different legal and tax jurisdictions. In line with our commitment to provide equitable, transparent, externally competitive, financially sustainable compensation and benefits, and to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, inroads is seeking a skilled, values-aligned consultant with expertise in supporting small global social organizations towards the objectives of institutionalizing equity-based practices, specifically equitable compensation. This aligns with our strategic goal to build a flexible and values-driven organization.
