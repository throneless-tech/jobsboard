The Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts (PPLM) and the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts (PPAF) seek an organizer based in Eastern MA, with a dedicated focus on Plymouth and Barnstable Counties in Southeastern MA. We are looking for a dynamic, fired up individual who shares the organizationâ€™s commitment to center its advocacy work around the needs of Planned Parenthood patients and their communities, and who understands the fight for equitable access to reproductive care is intrinsically tied to an empowered and engaged supporter base.
