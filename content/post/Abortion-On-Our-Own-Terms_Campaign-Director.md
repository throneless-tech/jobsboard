Abortion On Our Own Terms, a campaign to normalize, destigmatize, and decriminalize self-managed abortion, is seeking a high-level campaign director to oversee development and implementation of a long-term vision and day-to-day operations of the campaign. The Campaign Director will work closely with the campaign co-chairs to oversee a team of consultants who manage partnerships, communications, and community engagement, and a steering committee
of leading health, rights, and justice organizations. This position requires high-level strategic thinking and planning on a national scale, the ability to
work independently, soliciting input as needed for key decisions, and the aptitude to support the needs of a large and diverse coalition of organizations and stakeholders.
