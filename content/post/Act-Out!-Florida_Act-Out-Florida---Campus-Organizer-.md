College students in Florida can now apply to start an Act Out Chapter on their campus. For six months - from November 2023 to May 2024 - we will pay 8 organizers $100/month to raise awareness against harmful attacks towards LGBTQ Youth and Youth of Color such as the Donâ€™t Say Gay Bill and Stop Woke Acts across the state. Campus Organizers will use tactics such as tabling, phone banking, petitioning, and texting to recruit members for their chapters as well as for in-person event building for rapid response events.
