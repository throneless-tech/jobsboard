Provide is seeking a candidate with experience designing and delivering dynamic in-person and virtual training that incorporates antiracism and anti-oppression concepts, frameworks, and tools, to a variety of diverse audiences. We are looking for a candidate with the ability to tailor training to meet the needs of diverse audiences, with varying beliefs and attitudes toward abortion. Our ideal candidate has a strong understanding of how the intersections of systemic oppression (white supremacy, racism, sexism, ableism, classism, transphobia, etc.) negatively impact access to abortion and other stigmatized healthcare (drug use treatment, sexual health care, contraceptives, gender-affirming care, etc.).
