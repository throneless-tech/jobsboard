Preterm is seeking a permanent Executive Director after working with an Interim Director for a year and half who was promoted from within. Since the Dobbs decision, Ohio had a brief window of time in which our State's six week ban was enacted and Preterm could only see patients up to six weeks into a pregnancy, but as of last September, we have had an injunction keeping our doors open and abortion access available for up to 21 weeks into a pregnancy. This injunction is in no way permanent, and we are hoping to find new leadership to be nimble and help us pivot to our next phase of service delivery when and if our injunction is stricken down. Preterm offers ultrasound, sexual health, and miscarriage management services and serves as a beacon of reproductive health in our community after being open for 49 years and, for 45 of those years, operating out of the same building in a vibrant community on the east side of Cleveland. We are seeking a leader who is excited to work in a unionized environment, understands that the needs of patients and staff are of equal and utmost importance, and that preserving abortion access for our community is our priority.
